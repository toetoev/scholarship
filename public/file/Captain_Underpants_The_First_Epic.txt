ဒါနဲ့သူတို့ကဥပဒေနဲ့ရောညီလို့လား?
Which, by the way,
they are legally entitled to.

293

'Cause you could
really tell that's us.

327
00:16:34,295 --> 00:16:37,777
I can't believe it.
I gotcha.

328
00:16:38,055 --> 00:16:39,386
I finally gotcha!

329
00:16:39,975 --> 00:16:42,057
We've finally got them, sir.

330
00:16:42,215 --> 00:16:43,823
Yes, yes. Well done, Melvin.

331
00:16:43,853 --> 00:16:45,059
Extra credit granted.

332
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:48,058
Put that in my pocket.

333
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:52,296

<i>I</i> go! extra credit

335
00:16:54,415 --> 00:16:56,463
I told you
I would get you one day.

336
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:59,266
And that day I was talking about

337
00:16:59,335 --> 00:17:00,575
is this day.

338
00:17:00,735 --> 00:17:03,102
Today. This is the day.

339
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:04,951
Are you going to tell
our parents?

340
00:17:04,975 --> 00:17:07,421
No. Your parents are obviously
total failures.

341
00:17:07,575 --> 00:17:11,136
I have a much more effective
punishment in mind.

342
00:17:11,295 --> 00:17:15,778
Because I'm going to have
you two placed in separate...

343
00:17:17,095 --> 00:17:18,256
classes.

344
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,951
I'm going to annihilate
your friendship.

345
00:17:20,975 --> 00:17:21,976
What? No!

346
00:17:22,335 --> 00:17:25,179
You see?
You won't be together.

347
00:17:25,495 --> 00:17:27,179
You won't be able to enjoy

348
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:29,701
each other's company
and ruin my life.

349
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:32,176
Mr. Krupp, no.
You can't do this. Please.

350
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,457
This is too much.
I mean, even for you.

351
00:17:34,615 --> 00:17:36,617
Enjoy the rest
of your weekend, boys.

352
00:17:36,775 --> 00:17:38,459
Because come Monday...

353
00:17:47,135 --> 00:17:51,185
Separate classes.
Our friendship's over.

354
00:17:51,335 --> 00:17:52,825
I'll never see you again
in my life!

355
00:17:52,975 --> 00:17:54,625
Hey, hey. Calm down.

356
00:17:54,815 --> 00:17:56,055
It's not the end of the world.

357
00:17:56,215 --> 00:17:57,341
We'll still be best friends.

358
00:17:57,455 --> 00:17:59,822
Just way down the hall
from each other.

359
00:18:01,735 --> 00:18:03,976
What am I talking about?
This is bad.

360
00:18:04,135 --> 00:18:06,058
Long distance relationships
never work!

361
00:18:07,815 --> 00:18:09,305
This is just the beginning.

362
00:18:10,655 --> 00:18:12,145
Imagine the future.

363
00:18:14,575 --> 00:18:16,976
<i>Friends separated...</i>

364
00:18:18,535 --> 00:18:20,697
<i>promising each other
they'll remain besties.</i>

365
00:18:28,935 --> 00:18:30,266
<i>But within months,</i>

366
00:18:30,335 --> 00:18:32,656
<i>we'll be awkwardly bumping
into each other at the mall.</i>

367
00:18:32,855 --> 00:18:34,186
Hey, George.

368
00:18:34,335 --> 00:18:36,019
Hey. Do I know you?

369
00:18:36,175 --> 00:18:37,939
<i>You'll have a weird haircut.</i>

370
00:18:38,095 --> 00:18:40,257
<i>I'll be wearing
a suit for some reason.</i>

371
00:18:40,415 --> 00:18:41,541
<i>And before we know it,</i>

372
00:18:41,695 --> 00:18:43,535
<i>separate classes
will lead to separate lives...</i>

373
00:18:43,575 --> 00:18:45,623
<i>which inevitably
leads to robots.</i>

374
00:18:46,535 --> 00:18:48,537
What? Why are there robots
at the mall?

375
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:51,096
Because this is the future!
The future always has robots.

376
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:52,740
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

377
00:18:52,855 --> 00:18:54,778
Why are the robots
shooting other robots?

378
00:18:54,935 --> 00:18:56,295
Aren't they
supposed to be friends?

379
00:18:56,415 --> 00:18:57,416
I don't know!

380
00:18:57,575 --> 00:18:58,671
I'm the artist,
you're the writer.

381
00:18:58,695 --> 00:18:59,935
That's why we need each other.

382
00:19:06,775 --> 00:19:08,061
Help! Fire!

383
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,377
Okay, you're right.
No, you are right.

384
00:19:16,535 --> 00:19:18,299
I mean, if we get put
in separate classes,

385
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,104
it's the end of the world
as we know it.

386
00:19:20,255 --> 00:19:21,416
What are we gonna do?

387
00:19:21,575 --> 00:19:23,418
Oh, I'll tell you
what we're gonna do.

388
00:19:23,615 --> 00:19:26,585
First thing Monday morning,
we're getting that turtle.

389
00:19:34,255 --> 00:19:35,256
Edith!

390
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:36,940
Oh, is this a bad time?

391
00:19:37,055 --> 00:19:39,740
I did not mean to interrupt
the copying process.

392
00:19:39,895 --> 00:19:40,896
I'll go.

393
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:42,135
Yes, go! Please go.

394
00:19:42,295 --> 00:19:44,343
No, no. I'm just finishing up.

395
00:19:46,615 --> 00:19:49,095
What brings you around here?

396
00:19:49,975 --> 00:19:52,421
I just made
this tuna casserole...

397
00:19:52,575 --> 00:19:55,101
and I noticed
it had your name on it...

398
00:19:55,255 --> 00:19:57,576
In jalapeño peppers.

399
00:19:57,775 --> 00:19:58,981
Mmm...

400
00:19:59,255 --> 00:20:01,257
It smells spicy.

401
00:20:01,415 --> 00:20:02,940
Yep. Mmm-hmm.

402
00:20:03,095 --> 00:20:05,257
That's 'cause it's been
dry-aged for a week.

403
00:20:05,415 --> 00:20:06,826
I don't know what that means,

404
00:20:06,935 --> 00:20:08,425
but it sounds
very time-consuming.

405
00:20:08,615 --> 00:20:09,946
It took a week.

406
00:20:10,095 --> 00:20:12,621
Eww. They like each other.

407
00:20:12,775 --> 00:20:14,618
Oh, no, George.
I think it's much worse.

408
00:20:14,775 --> 00:20:16,504
They like-like each other.

409
00:20:16,655 --> 00:20:17,736
What are you talking about?

410
00:20:17,815 --> 00:20:19,544
Adults don't
like-like other adults.

411
00:20:19,695 --> 00:20:21,311
Well, you probably haven't
seen it at your home

412
00:20:21,335 --> 00:20:22,575
since your parents are married.

413
00:20:22,615 --> 00:20:25,300
In my studies, like-liking
seems to end with marriage.

414
00:20:26,215 --> 00:20:27,751
Well, I should probably gel
back to running the school.

415
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,584
You know,
it's not gonna run itself.

416
00:20:31,055 --> 00:20:32,341
But...

417
00:20:33,455 --> 00:20:37,858
Oh, Edith. Get your head
out of the clouds.

418
00:20:38,815 --> 00:20:42,058
Wait, Edith! You never gave me
the tuna casserole.

419
00:20:42,935 --> 00:20:44,664
I think he forgot the turtle.

420
00:20:44,815 --> 00:20:46,055
Go, go, go-

421
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:48,661
That's important.

422
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:50,385
Great. What now?

423
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:57,181
<i>Hello.
If you would like the chance</i>

424
00:20:57,335 --> 00:20:59,144
<i>to win one billion dollars...
Ooh.</i>

425
00:20:59,335 --> 00:21:01,064
Please hold for
one of our representatives.

426
00:21:15,335 --> 00:21:17,064
It's gotta be in here somewhere.

427
00:21:18,015 --> 00:21:19,016
Ugh.

428
00:21:22,175 --> 00:21:23,506
Whoa!
What?

429
00:21:23,655 --> 00:21:25,862
Everything Krupp
ever confiscated from us.

430
00:21:26,015 --> 00:21:27,699
Look at all that stuff.

431
00:21:27,895 --> 00:21:29,624
Oh, dear old whoopee cushion.

432
00:21:29,775 --> 00:21:31,539
You will sing once again.

433
00:21:33,175 --> 00:21:36,543
Oh, my
Super Duper Soaking Machine!

434
00:21:38,175 --> 00:21:39,256
MY hypno-ring!

435
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,457
I never even got to take it
out of the wrapper.

436
00:21:42,495 --> 00:21:43,495
Wow.

437
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:44,536
Look at this.

438
00:21:44,695 --> 00:21:46,231
He's got every issue
of Captain Underpants

439
00:21:46,255 --> 00:21:47,302
we've ever created.

440
00:21:47,455 --> 00:21:48,456
You think he reads them?

441
00:21:48,615 --> 00:21:49,831
I was kinda hoping
that we appealed

442
00:21:49,855 --> 00:21:51,584
to a slightly
cooler demographic.

443
00:21:52,775 --> 00:21:55,984
Well, if it isn't George Beard
and Harold Hutchins.

444
00:21:56,135 --> 00:21:58,137
To what do I owe the pleasure?

445
00:21:58,295 --> 00:22:00,059
Is it perhaps this?

446
00:22:00,135 --> 00:22:01,296
Oh, no.

447
00:22:01,455 --> 00:22:02,616
Nice try.

448
00:22:02,815 --> 00:22:04,738
Turtle and I have grown
quite attached.

449
00:22:04,895 --> 00:22:06,545
We're inseparable, actually.

450
00:22:06,735 --> 00:22:08,225
I carry him wherever I go.

451
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:10,662
Including the shower!

452
00:22:12,575 --> 00:22:13,940
<i>Oh.
Poor 'name.</i>

453
00:22:17,495 --> 00:22:18,906
Oh, what's this?

454
00:22:19,895 --> 00:22:20,896
Why, it's the paperwork

455
00:22:20,975 --> 00:22:22,898
to separate you two.

456
00:22:23,215 --> 00:22:24,296
It's really incredible.

457
00:22:24,415 --> 00:22:27,897
I can actually see
the end of your friendship.

458
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,422
And it ends right here.

459
00:22:30,575 --> 00:22:32,577
On this dotted line.

460
00:22:33,255 --> 00:22:34,780
George, do something.

461
00:22:35,495 --> 00:22:36,985
Put the pen down, Mr. Krupp...

462
00:22:37,135 --> 00:22:38,500
or we'll hypnotize you.

463
00:22:38,655 --> 00:22:39,656
What?
What?

464
00:22:39,815 --> 00:22:40,976
You said do something.

465
00:22:41,135 --> 00:22:42,182
What is that?

466
00:22:42,335 --> 00:22:45,976
Forged from the molten
plastic of Shandong, China.

467
00:22:46,135 --> 00:22:48,615
<i>In the lowest floor
of the darkest basement</i>

468
00:22:48,775 --> 00:22:51,779
<i>where only toy prizes
dare be made...</i>

469
00:22:51,935 --> 00:22:53,778
<i>exists the most powerful item...</i>

470
00:22:53,935 --> 00:22:57,337
<i>ever to be found in a box
of Frosted Sugar Doodles.</i>

471
00:22:58,015 --> 00:22:59,938
The hypno-ring.

472
00:23:00,495 --> 00:23:01,621
Hypnotize me?

473
00:23:01,695 --> 00:23:03,504
With that piece of plastic junk?

474
00:23:04,775 --> 00:23:05,856
Does that really work?

475
00:23:06,015 --> 00:23:07,983
What do you think?
I got it out of a cereal box.

476
00:23:08,135 --> 00:23:09,216
I'm warning you.

477
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:10,431
If you don't do what we say,

478
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:11,695
you're gonna get really sleepy.

479
00:23:11,815 --> 00:23:14,386
Oh, will I?
I'll get sleepy?

480
00:23:14,535 --> 00:23:16,185
With that thing pointing at me'?

481
00:23:16,335 --> 00:23:17,985
It's not making me sleepy.

482
00:23:20,975 --> 00:23:22,704
I'm not gonna get sleepy from...

483
00:23:22,895 --> 00:23:23,896
Whoa!

484
00:23:26,815 --> 00:23:29,341
What kind of
plastic hokum is this?

485
00:23:29,495 --> 00:23:30,621
Whoa!

486
00:23:30,815 --> 00:23:31,991
What's happening?
I don't know.

487
00:23:32,015 --> 00:23:33,665
Why are we floating?

488
00:23:47,815 --> 00:23:49,146
What was that?

489
00:23:49,335 --> 00:23:50,416
I don't know.

490
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:52,135
I honestly didn't think
that would happen.

491
00:23:57,615 --> 00:24:00,186
Gotcha. You're safe now,
little turtle.

492
00:24:02,695 --> 00:24:04,026
<i>When I snap my fingers,</i>

493
00:24:04,095 --> 00:24:05,859
you will obey our every command.

494
00:24:06,015 --> 00:24:07,346
Wait. How do you know this?

495
00:24:07,495 --> 00:24:08,631
I don't know.
I just say the first thing

496
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:10,311
that comes to my mind
with great authority.

497
00:24:10,335 --> 00:24:12,497
You are now a chicken.

498
00:24:23,535 --> 00:24:24,536
N worked!

499
00:24:25,175 --> 00:24:26,256
He's a chicken.

500
00:24:26,455 --> 00:24:27,695
Okay, let me try. Let me try.

501
00:24:28,575 --> 00:24:29,781
You're a monkey.

502
00:24:35,695 --> 00:24:37,697
Oh! Look at him,
he's a monkey!

503
00:24:45,535 --> 00:24:46,535
Come on.

504
00:24:46,575 --> 00:24:47,701
You are now

505
00:24:47,815 --> 00:24:50,705
the greatest superhero
of all time...

506
00:24:50,895 --> 00:24:53,501
the amazing Captain Underpants!

507
00:25:08,255 --> 00:25:11,020
Tra-la-laaaaa!

508
00:25:12,415 --> 00:25:15,897
Captain Underpants?
Is that really you?

509
00:25:16,455 --> 00:25:17,661
Let's see.

510
00:25:17,815 --> 00:25:19,579
Underpants, check.

511
00:25:19,735 --> 00:25:21,942
Captain, also check.

512
00:25:22,295 --> 00:25:25,344
I'm pretty sure
I'm Captain Underpants.

513
00:25:27,615 --> 00:25:28,616
It worked!

514
00:25:29,855 --> 00:25:32,426
Which must make you
my trusty sidekicks!

515
00:25:32,815 --> 00:25:33,816
Sidekicks?

516
00:25:34,255 --> 00:25:37,623
Fear not, this planet is safe
under my watchful eye.

517
00:25:37,775 --> 00:25:39,425
This is hilarious!
This is amazing!

518
00:25:39,695 --> 00:25:40,935
Let's see what's afoot.

519
00:25:42,095 --> 00:25:43,096
Wait, no!

520
00:25:44,935 --> 00:25:46,778
Well, that was invigorating.

521
00:25:46,935 --> 00:25:48,460
We gotta stop him.
Why?

522
00:25:49,735 --> 00:25:50,735
Huzzah!

523
00:25:50,775 --> 00:25:51,776
Out of the road, bozo!

524
00:25:51,935 --> 00:25:53,664
Why, thank you, vehicle person!

525
00:25:53,855 --> 00:25:54,902
Ow!

526
00:25:54,975 --> 00:25:56,500
Yeah, we should
probably go get him.

527
00:25:58,255 --> 00:26:00,257
Captain Underpants, wait!

528
00:26:04,335 --> 00:26:05,666
Oh!
Ha-ha!

529
00:26:06,055 --> 00:26:07,056
What is this?

530
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:09,504
Poor soul. You're trapped

531
00:26:09,615 --> 00:26:12,459
in some sort of
invisible box-like prison.

532
00:26:12,615 --> 00:26:15,061
What's that? I can't hear you.

533
00:26:15,215 --> 00:26:16,899
But I see your tears.

534
00:26:17,055 --> 00:26:19,137
Is it okay
that I'm kinda loving this?

535
00:26:19,295 --> 00:26:21,138
Yes and no. But mostly yes.

536
00:26:21,975 --> 00:26:23,977
Fear not
for I will set you free!

537
00:26:24,055 --> 00:26:25,056
Ow!
Ooh!

538
00:26:25,175 --> 00:26:26,301
What is wrong with you?

539
00:26:26,495 --> 00:26:28,145
Ah, that's better.
I can hear you now.

540
00:26:28,575 --> 00:26:30,020
Sorry, sorry. We're so sorry.

541
00:26:30,175 --> 00:26:31,215
Okay, listen, let's not be

542
00:26:31,335 --> 00:26:32,631
punching people,
though, because...

543
00:26:32,655 --> 00:26:33,986
Hold n.

544
00:26:34,895 --> 00:26:36,340
Here, let me help.
Oh!

545
00:26:36,415 --> 00:26:38,338
You're welcome, madam.

546
00:26:38,495 --> 00:26:39,831
You know,
we should probably get you

547
00:26:39,855 --> 00:26:41,471
back to the school
before anything else...

548
00:26:41,495 --> 00:26:42,496
Halt!
What?

549
00:26:42,655 --> 00:26:44,339
Do you sense that?
No.

550
00:26:44,495 --> 00:26:45,542
Well, of course you don't.

551
00:26:45,655 --> 00:26:47,180
You're not a superhero like me.

552
00:26:47,335 --> 00:26:49,576
Come, sidekicks.
Evil lurks within!

553
00:26:49,735 --> 00:26:50,736
Oh, no!

554
00:26:53,335 --> 00:26:54,700
Where'd he go now?

555
00:26:54,895 --> 00:26:56,943
To the sky!

556
00:27:06,415 --> 00:27:08,271
You'd think a guy like him
would be easy to find.

557
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:09,295
Found him.

558
00:27:09,335 --> 00:27:11,941
Stand down,
you giant ape monster!

559
00:27:12,095 --> 00:27:14,746
Giant ape monster?
What is he talking...

560
00:27:15,295 --> 00:27:18,697
Your days of terrifying
this town are over!

561
00:27:18,855 --> 00:27:20,619
Mr. Krupp!
I mean, Captain Underpants!

562
00:27:20,775 --> 00:27:23,221
You can't actually fly!

563
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:25,298
Now I take to the sky...

564
00:27:25,455 --> 00:27:26,581
like an ostrich!

565
00:27:30,455 --> 00:27:32,105
<i>I</i> gotcha!

566
00:27:35,935 --> 00:27:37,585
We gotta do something.

567
00:27:37,775 --> 00:27:39,061
I've got an idea.

568
00:27:40,895 --> 00:27:42,420
Morning.
Morning.

569
00:27:44,575 --> 00:27:46,464
Oh, that is a lot of buttons.

570
00:27:49,495 --> 00:27:51,736
Take that! Ah, cheap shot!

571
00:27:52,095 --> 00:27:53,904
Ow! Right in the kisser!

572
00:27:55,455 --> 00:27:56,456
No!

573
00:27:59,735 --> 00:28:00,736
Oh, hi, guys!

574
00:28:00,895 --> 00:28:01,942
Wait! No!

575
00:28:02,295 --> 00:28:03,342
Follow that gorilla!

576
00:28:05,415 --> 00:28:07,258
Oh, you put up a good fight!

577
00:28:10,415 --> 00:28:13,339
Yeah! You are so good
at operating a crane, Harold.

578
00:28:13,495 --> 00:28:15,259
I know!
It's really not that hard.

579
00:28:15,855 --> 00:28:17,135
Rest assured,

580
00:28:17,175 --> 00:28:18,825
citizens of
this marvelous metropolis...

581
00:28:18,975 --> 00:28:21,626
I will rid you of this menace
any moment now!

582
00:28:21,815 --> 00:28:24,625
Come on. Oh, come on,
come on, come on.

583
00:28:24,775 --> 00:28:25,981
Victory!

584
00:28:26,135 --> 00:28:27,421
Yes!
Bravo!

585
00:28:27,615 --> 00:28:28,855
Oh, no, no, no!

586
00:28:32,815 --> 00:28:36,137
Let that be a lesson
to evildoers everywhere.

587
00:28:36,335 --> 00:28:39,464
Never underestimate the power
of underwear!

588
00:28:39,615 --> 00:28:41,379
Who the heck are you?

589
00:28:41,455 --> 00:28:42,455
What the...

590
00:28:47,775 --> 00:28:50,460
Wow! I can't believe
we found a spot.

591
00:28:50,615 --> 00:28:53,016
Oh, goodness.
Grandpa, you did it again.

592
00:28:53,535 --> 00:28:54,616
He's a sleepwalker.

593
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:56,857
Come on, pap pap,
let's get you back into bed.

594
00:28:57,015 --> 00:28:58,699
But what about all the other
evil villains?

595
00:28:58,895 --> 00:29:00,101
Well, don't worry about that.

596
00:29:00,175 --> 00:29:01,815
There's no more
evil villains around here.

597
00:29:03,855 --> 00:29:06,825
A science teacher, hmm?

598
00:29:06,975 --> 00:29:08,977
The perfect cover.

599
00:29:15,495 --> 00:29:18,817
Chums! What
an astounding headquarters.

600
00:29:18,975 --> 00:29:20,864
Stuffed full of relics...

601
00:29:21,015 --> 00:29:24,224
all celebrating
my interplanetary exploits!

602
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:25,979
Oh, this takes me back.

603
00:29:26,415 --> 00:29:28,383
What are we gonna do?
He can't just stay here.

604
00:29:28,535 --> 00:29:30,060
We have to turn him back
into Krupp.

605
00:29:30,215 --> 00:29:31,785
I know,
but can we just take a moment

606
00:29:31,855 --> 00:29:33,575
to acknowledge
what's happening here please?

607
00:29:33,695 --> 00:29:37,541
I mean, Captain Underpants is
hanging out in our tree house!

608
00:29:38,175 --> 00:29:40,064
Look at the cute little turtle.

609
00:29:40,175 --> 00:29:41,904
Oh, he's so adorable.

610
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:46,065
Well, a hero's work
is never done.

611
00:29:46,175 --> 00:29:48,337
Now it is time to fly again!

612
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:49,781
No, no, no, no!

613
00:29:51,615 --> 00:29:52,616
Where am I?

614
00:29:52,775 --> 00:29:54,061
Where are my pants?

615
00:29:54,215 --> 00:29:55,262
Oh, no! He's Krupp again.

616
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,746
Ah!

617
00:29:57,055 --> 00:29:58,705
Tra-la-laaa!

618
00:29:58,855 --> 00:30:00,935
That's it! Now we know
what turns him hack and forth.

619
00:30:01,015 --> 00:30:02,176
Turns who what?

620
00:30:02,695 --> 00:30:03,696
Why am I soaking wet?

621
00:30:03,855 --> 00:30:05,016
Cool.
Hey.

622
00:30:05,215 --> 00:30:06,865
Tra-la-laaa!

623
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:08,904
Harold!
Tra-Ia...

624
00:30:09,055 --> 00:30:10,784
George!
Laaa!

625
00:30:10,935 --> 00:30:12,096
We should probably stop.

626
00:30:12,255 --> 00:30:13,381
Yeah, we probably should.

627
00:30:13,535 --> 00:30:15,378
Stop doing this!
Tra-la...

628
00:30:15,455 --> 00:30:17,105
I am Captain...

629
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:18,551
What are you doing?

630
00:30:18,575 --> 00:30:19,576
Hello? Well, hello!

631
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,544
What's happening?
Fear not!

632
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:23,351
Didn't know I could do this.
Hey, sidekicks!

633
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:24,786
Tra! Hey! Heyo!

634
00:30:27,895 --> 00:30:28,976
Tra-la-laaa!

635
00:30:31,735 --> 00:30:33,100
Okay, this is the street.

636
00:30:34,215 --> 00:30:35,655
Come on, come on.
We're almost there.

637
00:30:38,455 --> 00:30:39,900
Evening.
Evening.

638
00:30:40,735 --> 00:30:43,102
Drop it. No, get off. Gimme!
That's a bad dog.

639
00:30:50,895 --> 00:30:51,942
We made it.

640
00:30:52,735 --> 00:30:53,736
Yeesh.

641
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:56,977
I wonder
what horrors lie inside.

642
00:30:57,135 --> 00:30:58,978
There's probably
wild dogs in there.

643
00:30:59,135 --> 00:31:00,535
Probably torture implements.

644
00:31:00,575 --> 00:31:01,576
Rabid rats.

645
00:31:01,655 --> 00:31:02,736
Brains in jars.

646
00:31:02,935 --> 00:31:04,425
Jars of plucked-out eyeballs.

647
00:31:04,575 --> 00:31:06,304
Bones of former students.

648
00:31:13,615 --> 00:31:14,696
Why'd you scream?

649
00:31:14,855 --> 00:31:16,619
I just assumed
there'd be something scary...

650
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:18,700
but it's actually
a really nice place.

651
00:31:25,295 --> 00:31:26,660
We probably
shouldn't snoop around.

652
00:31:26,815 --> 00:31:28,658
Yeah. Definitely not.

653
00:31:31,175 --> 00:31:32,176
Come on.

654
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:36,936
Huh.

655
00:31:38,615 --> 00:31:39,616
Hmm.

656
00:31:41,135 --> 00:31:42,978
Not So Cheery O's?

657
00:31:43,295 --> 00:31:45,138
This guy's bumming me out.

658
00:31:52,655 --> 00:31:54,896
I gotta say, this has
not been the funnest snoop.

659
00:31:55,055 --> 00:31:58,184
Yeah, no, totally.
Really sad snoop.

660
00:31:58,335 --> 00:32:00,144
Kinda regretting it, actually.

661
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:11,706
I sure hope we don't ever
end up like him.

662
00:32:11,855 --> 00:32:13,345
All alone.

663
00:32:14,495 --> 00:32:16,615
It's impossible.
That would never happen.

664
00:32:16,695 --> 00:32:18,697
Yeah, yeah.
That'll never happen.

665
00:32:19,695 --> 00:32:22,505
<i>Unless he puts us
in separate classes.</i>

666
00:32:24,095 --> 00:32:26,257
Which will never happen.

667
00:32:27,175 --> 00:32:30,258
It'll never happen.
'Cause we control him now.

668
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:32,065
And if ever gives us
any trouble again,

669
00:32:32,175 --> 00:32:33,859
all we gotta do
is snap our fingers...

670
00:32:34,015 --> 00:32:35,426
and "Tra-la-laa!"

671
00:32:35,615 --> 00:32:38,061
All of our problems go away.

672
00:32:47,415 --> 00:32:49,019
Oh, yeah

673
00:32:58,095 --> 00:32:59,540
<i>Beautiful</i>

674
00:33:04,535 --> 00:33:06,697
<i>Even more beautiful</i>

675
00:33:10,575 --> 00:33:11,695
Hey, Tommy. What's going on?

676
00:33:11,775 --> 00:33:12,776
<i>Hey, guys-</i>

677
00:33:13,055 --> 00:33:14,898
Whoa! Cool shirts!

678
00:33:16,095 --> 00:33:17,745
What are you two doing together?

679
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:19,786
I separated you.

680
00:33:20,735 --> 00:33:21,735
No, you didn't.

681
00:33:21,775 --> 00:33:22,936
What are you talking about?

682
00:33:23,095 --> 00:33:25,416
I signed the paperwork. See?

683
00:33:25,495 --> 00:33:26,496
I don't see a signature.

684
00:33:26,575 --> 00:33:27,711
Harold, do you see a signature?

685
00:33:27,735 --> 00:33:29,225
Not a thing.

686
00:33:29,415 --> 00:33:31,775
I actually can't see a thing.
These sunglasses are too dark.

687
00:33:31,895 --> 00:33:34,296
What? I could have sworn
I signed that thing.

688
00:33:34,455 --> 00:33:36,822
No matter. There!

689
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:38,579
Officially separated.

690
00:33:38,735 --> 00:33:40,339
Forever.

691
00:33:42,335 --> 00:33:45,259
What? Give me that.
Tra-la-laaa!

692
00:33:45,415 --> 00:33:46,985
See? Problem solved.

693
00:33:47,415 --> 00:33:49,019
Ooh!

694
00:33:50,735 --> 00:33:52,419
Greetings, citizens!

695
00:33:52,575 --> 00:33:53,576
Quick, in here.

696
00:33:57,015 --> 00:33:58,062
Okay, you know what?

697
00:33:58,135 --> 00:33:59,625
These shirts were way premature.

698
00:33:59,775 --> 00:34:01,106
Definitely. Come on.

699
00:34:01,255 --> 00:34:02,391
Let's turn him back into Krupp.

700
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,497
We can't. He'll separate us,
remember?

701
00:34:04,935 --> 00:34:06,071
Yeah, well, we can't have him

702
00:34:06,095 --> 00:34:07,540
wandering around
looking like that.

703
00:34:07,775 --> 00:34:09,857
A triangle!

704
00:34:09,935 --> 00:34:12,222
<i>It</i> dings!

705
00:34:26,135 --> 00:34:28,741
Ah! Principal Krupp,
you caught us again.

706
00:34:29,975 --> 00:34:31,625
You better take us
to your office

707
00:34:31,735 --> 00:34:33,578
for a good old talking-to.

708
00:34:34,135 --> 00:34:35,864
Right? Principal Krupp?

709
00:34:36,015 --> 00:34:37,311
Principal who?

710
00:34:37,335 --> 00:34:38,860
Captain Underpants,
get out here.

711
00:34:40,015 --> 00:34:41,016
Sidekicks...

712
00:34:41,175 --> 00:34:42,176
are you sure

713
00:34:42,295 --> 00:34:44,024
my secret identity
requires these...

714
00:34:44,655 --> 00:34:47,340
restricting,
uncomfortable clothes?

715
00:34:47,535 --> 00:34:48,536
Yes, positive.

716
00:34:48,695 --> 00:34:51,505
100% positive.
Now act like a principal.

717
00:34:51,655 --> 00:34:52,702
Oh, right.

718
00:34:53,135 --> 00:34:54,341
How does a principal act?

719
00:34:54,455 --> 00:34:55,455
Mean!

720
00:34:55,495 --> 00:34:56,542
Okey-doke.

721
00:35:00,175 --> 00:35:01,506
I'm a principal!

722
00:35:02,015 --> 00:35:03,016
Oh, yeah. That's great.

723
00:35:03,655 --> 00:35:05,180
Come on. We're almost there.

724
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:08,823
Oh, hello. Surprise.

725
00:35:09,495 --> 00:35:11,020
It's Edith.

726
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:13,177
Did you like my tuna casserole?

727
00:35:13,855 --> 00:35:15,664
I cannot lie.

728
00:35:15,855 --> 00:35:18,381
I don't recall
having your tuna casserole.

729
00:35:18,535 --> 00:35:20,344
What? Oh.

730
00:35:20,495 --> 00:35:21,906
But if your casserole is

731
00:35:22,015 --> 00:35:25,224
as striking
<i>as</i> your one blue eye...

732
00:35:25,695 --> 00:35:28,346
Oh, I didn't think you noticed.

733
00:35:28,735 --> 00:35:29,736
Oh, my.

734
00:35:30,855 --> 00:35:32,903
Two blue eyes.

735
00:35:34,055 --> 00:35:35,864
Ooh!

736
00:35:36,695 --> 00:35:38,379
Principal Krupp.
It's time to go.

737
00:35:38,535 --> 00:35:39,696
Gotta wrap it up.

738
00:35:39,855 --> 00:35:41,016
Very well then.

739
00:35:41,215 --> 00:35:42,376
Up, up, and...

740
00:35:42,535 --> 00:35:44,537
And this way, sir.

741
00:35:44,855 --> 00:35:47,699
Ooh! Flirt alert.

742
00:35:47,855 --> 00:35:49,220
A-ha!

743
00:35:50,415 --> 00:35:51,826
Wow, she's still on hold.

744
00:35:53,535 --> 00:35:55,219
Phew! We made it.

745
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:57,104
Well, hello, citizen.
What?

746
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:58,295
Oh, and hello to you, too.

747
00:35:58,415 --> 00:36:00,417
I was just, like,
admiring the view...

748
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,225
from your broken window.

749
00:36:02,375 --> 00:36:04,104
It's in the shape of a man.

750
00:36:04,255 --> 00:36:05,461
Anyway, lam here to interview

751
00:36:05,575 --> 00:36:07,100
for the science teacher
position.

752
00:36:07,255 --> 00:36:08,620
Perfect. I'm disguised

753
00:36:08,735 --> 00:36:10,180
as an elementary
school principal.

754
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:12,900
Guys, I totally got this.

755
00:36:13,055 --> 00:36:14,580
Don't worry one bit.

756
00:36:18,615 --> 00:36:21,061
Now, where did I put
that resume?

757
00:36:21,255 --> 00:36:22,415
No, not that. Oh, this thing.

758
00:36:23,415 --> 00:36:24,416
This one's fun.

759
00:36:24,575 --> 00:36:25,781
Ooh!
Heads up.

760
00:36:25,895 --> 00:36:27,385
That one's gonna leave a mark.

761
00:36:27,535 --> 00:36:28,900
I've been looking for that.

762
00:36:29,095 --> 00:36:30,096
Oh, not that.

763
00:36:31,695 --> 00:36:32,776
Ah-ha! Here we go.

764
00:36:34,935 --> 00:36:38,064
Hmm. Says here
you're a science teacher?

765
00:36:38,215 --> 00:36:39,421
Not exactly.

766
00:36:39,575 --> 00:36:41,577
But you have
teaching experience?

767
00:36:41,775 --> 00:36:43,106
Oh, no, I can't say that I do.

768
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,378
Not even, like, babysitting?

769
00:36:45,535 --> 00:36:46,775
I would never sit on a baby.

770
00:36:46,935 --> 00:36:47,936
Camp counselor?

771
00:36:48,095 --> 00:36:49,381
Never was a camp counselor.

772
00:36:49,575 --> 00:36:51,065
Although
I did receive counseling...

773
00:36:51,215 --> 00:36:54,458
for some trauma I experienced
as a child.

774
00:36:54,975 --> 00:36:57,455
I'm getting a really good vibe
about you.

775
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:59,583
Now hold on.
Let me see that resume.

776
00:36:59,735 --> 00:37:01,942
It says here that you were
a genius inventor?

777
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:03,301
Mad...

778
00:37:03,655 --> 00:37:06,977
genius inventor.
But yes.

779
00:37:07,175 --> 00:37:09,098
And then for
the last few years...

780
00:37:09,255 --> 00:37:10,939
you've "been in
a very dark place"...

781
00:37:11,135 --> 00:37:12,341
and your title was...

782
00:37:12,495 --> 00:37:14,418
"Revenge Seeker?"

783
00:37:14,575 --> 00:37:15,940
"Revenge at all costs...

784
00:37:16,095 --> 00:37:17,096
"Die! Die!"

785
00:37:17,255 --> 00:37:18,256
Am I reading this right?

786
00:37:18,415 --> 00:37:20,497
Yeah, that's basically
what I've been up to...

787
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,419
so here I am!

788
00:37:22,575 --> 00:37:23,736
Applying for a job in

789
00:37:23,815 --> 00:37:26,295
the thriving
public school system...

790
00:37:26,455 --> 00:37:29,664
with all of
its amazing resources.

791
00:37:30,255 --> 00:37:33,020
But honestly,
kids are so understanding.

792
00:37:33,175 --> 00:37:34,779
So innocent.

793
00:37:34,935 --> 00:37:37,939
Their smiles brighten my heart
and fill me with...

794
00:37:38,095 --> 00:37:41,019
a joy-adjacent feeling.

795
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:43,496
As long
as they are controlled...

796
00:37:43,655 --> 00:37:46,465
and do not laugh
nor smile nor play nor laugh.

797
00:37:46,615 --> 00:37:48,185
Children must never laugh!

798
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,818
Well, you seem terrific!

799
00:37:50,975 --> 00:37:52,136
You're hired!

800
00:37:52,295 --> 00:37:53,865
What?
Excellent.

801
00:37:54,055 --> 00:37:56,023
Oh, by the way,
going to need Fridays off...

802
00:37:56,175 --> 00:37:58,064
and every other Tuesday
through Thursday...

803
00:37:58,215 --> 00:37:59,501
for my evil experiments.

804
00:37:59,655 --> 00:38:02,340
Hope that's not a problem.
Okay, bye-bye!

805
00:38:03,975 --> 00:38:05,056
Oh, this is bad.

806
00:38:05,215 --> 00:38:07,502
We just hired a maniac
for a science teacher!

807
00:38:07,655 --> 00:38:10,022
Uh, yeah. We gotta fix this
before Krupp finds out.

808
00:38:10,495 --> 00:38:12,304
Sounds like a job
for Captain Underpants.

809
00:38:12,455 --> 00:38:14,696
No, no, no.
You need to stay here.

810
00:38:14,855 --> 00:38:16,380
Okay, you're
the principal, remember?

811
00:38:16,575 --> 00:38:18,862
Yeah, just sit there
and look angry for no reason.

812
00:38:19,015 --> 00:38:21,177
You got it. Grr...

813
00:38:26,695 --> 00:38:27,696
Ooh!

814
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:30,343
That will be interesting
to put my eye up to.

815
00:38:30,735 --> 00:38:32,897
What?
How did I get here?

816
00:38:33,095 --> 00:38:34,335
Why is my face wet?

817
00:38:47,495 --> 00:38:48,701
Hiya, class.

818
00:38:48,855 --> 00:38:50,220
I'm your cool, new teacher.

819
00:38:50,375 --> 00:38:53,618
Not some scary guy
with a secret evil agenda.

820
00:38:55,695 --> 00:38:58,175
Anyway, I'm just going to dive
right in here.

821
00:38:58,335 --> 00:38:59,575
If there was one thing

822
00:38:59,695 --> 00:39:01,295
about this world
that you could change...

823
00:39:01,735 --> 00:39:02,736
what would it be?

824
00:39:02,895 --> 00:39:04,738
Ooh! Ooh! Peace on Earth.

825
00:39:04,895 --> 00:39:06,897
Unattainable. Anyone else?

826
00:39:07,735 --> 00:39:09,419
Pacific Ocean into chocolate.

827
00:39:09,575 --> 00:39:11,065
Atlantic into nacho cheese.

828
00:39:11,255 --> 00:39:12,620
Ifs like we're the same person

829
00:39:12,735 --> 00:39:13,896
and yet so, so different.

830
00:39:14,095 --> 00:39:15,745
I love it.

831
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,545
But more importantly...

832
00:39:17,695 --> 00:39:21,097
if I had to change one thing
about the world...

833
00:39:21,255 --> 00:39:24,941
it would be to get rid of...

834
00:39:25,095 --> 00:39:26,096
laughter.

835
00:39:28,415 --> 00:39:29,826
Get rid of laughter?

836
00:39:29,975 --> 00:39:31,545
What kind of person
wants to do that?

837
00:39:31,655 --> 00:39:32,656
Oh, Oh! Ah! Ah! Sir, sir.

838
00:39:32,775 --> 00:39:33,776
<i>Yes'?</i>

839
00:39:33,855 --> 00:39:34,856
I love it.

840
00:39:34,935 --> 00:39:36,778
Oh, look at this.
We got a grade A suck-up.

841
00:39:36,935 --> 00:39:38,824
Good to know, good to know.

842
00:39:38,975 --> 00:39:39,976
<i>Anyway.</i>

843
00:39:41,455 --> 00:39:44,982
This is the brain
of an average child.

844
00:39:45,135 --> 00:39:46,182
Right here is

845
00:39:46,295 --> 00:39:48,263
the "thinking about candy"
lopalus.

846
00:39:48,415 --> 00:39:50,463
The "fear of
what's under the bed" lobe.

847
00:39:50,615 --> 00:39:53,141
This is the "only thing
I'll eat is pizza...

848
00:39:53,295 --> 00:39:55,980
"chicken nuggets,
or buttered noodles" lobe.

849
00:39:56,175 --> 00:39:57,745
Right here is the

850
00:39:57,815 --> 00:39:59,658
"as soon as
someone else has a toy...

851
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:02,261
"I want that toy" anterior lobe.

852
00:40:02,815 --> 00:40:04,146
And this...

853
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:08,144
This is the
Hahaguffawchuckleamalus.

854
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:10,697
This funny little purple part

855
00:40:10,815 --> 00:40:14,137
holds our entire capacity
for laughter.

856
00:40:14,295 --> 00:40:16,696
For years,
I've tried to shrink it

857
00:40:16,815 --> 00:40:18,783
or cut it out entirely...

858
00:40:20,655 --> 00:40:22,419
but frustratingly,

859
00:40:22,495 --> 00:40:25,499
our survival seems
dependent upon it.

860
00:40:26,495 --> 00:40:28,782
I don't like this. I mean,
I don't really understand it.

861
00:40:28,935 --> 00:40:30,215
But the stuff I am understanding

862
00:40:30,295 --> 00:40:31,501
seems genuinely bad to me.

863
00:40:31,655 --> 00:40:32,861
Yeah, same.

864
00:40:33,015 --> 00:40:35,939
Um... Excuse me, Professor P?

865
00:40:36,135 --> 00:40:37,978
Why are you trying to
get rid of laughter?

866
00:40:38,175 --> 00:40:39,506
Isn't laughter
the best medicine?

867
00:40:39,655 --> 00:40:43,137
Medicine is the best medicine!
So...

868
00:40:43,335 --> 00:40:44,461
Yeesh.

869
00:40:45,855 --> 00:40:46,856
What?

870
00:40:47,015 --> 00:40:48,062
What does the P stand for?

871
00:40:48,535 --> 00:40:49,536
Excuse me?

872
00:40:49,615 --> 00:40:51,856
The P. In your name.
What does it stand for?

873
00:40:52,015 --> 00:40:53,505
Oh, it's private.

874
00:40:53,695 --> 00:40:57,063
So that means your name is
Professor Privates?

875
00:41:00,175 --> 00:41:01,700
What's so funny?

876
00:41:01,855 --> 00:41:03,061
I don't get it.

877
00:41:04,535 --> 00:41:05,582
Principal's office, now!

878
00:41:05,695 --> 00:41:06,696
You too!

879
00:41:06,855 --> 00:41:07,981
Why him?

880
00:41:08,135 --> 00:41:10,581
Because your friendship
and shared sense of humor

881
00:41:10,695 --> 00:41:11,856
irritates me...

882
00:41:12,015 --> 00:41:14,222
and must be destroyed!

883
00:41:15,855 --> 00:41:17,935
We gotta do something about
that new science teacher.

884
00:41:18,015 --> 00:41:20,382
Yeah, it's like he's even more
of a villain than Krupp.

885
00:41:20,535 --> 00:41:22,264
I didn't even think
that was possible.

886
00:41:22,415 --> 00:41:23,911
Whoa! Whoa! Wait a second.
Tell me about it.

887
00:41:23,935 --> 00:41:25,585
What? Who do you think...

888
00:41:25,735 --> 00:41:27,575
Oh, okay. Maybe we could
fix this if we just...

889
00:41:27,695 --> 00:41:29,265
Can you hear me?
No, that'll never work.

890
00:41:29,375 --> 00:41:31,184
I'm sitting right here.

891
00:41:31,335 --> 00:41:33,781
Wait, Professor P doesn't want
anybody to know his last name.

892
00:41:33,935 --> 00:41:35,016
Right?
Right!

893
00:41:35,175 --> 00:41:36,859
Who's Professor P?
Exactly!

894
00:41:37,015 --> 00:41:40,736
Where is the respect?
I am your principal!

895
00:41:41,615 --> 00:41:42,776
Wait, is he Krupp again?

896
00:41:42,935 --> 00:41:44,778
George!
Yup. Pretty sure he is.

897
00:41:44,895 --> 00:41:45,896
Harold!

898
00:41:45,975 --> 00:41:46,976
How'd that even happen?

899
00:41:48,095 --> 00:41:49,859
Tra-la-laaa!

900
00:41:50,015 --> 00:41:53,064
Greetings!
I need to get the...

901
00:41:53,255 --> 00:41:54,535
Sidekicks, what do I need again?

902
00:41:54,575 --> 00:41:56,862
The file
on the new science teacher.

903
00:41:56,935 --> 00:41:57,936
Oh, right, right.

904
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,416
I need the bile
on the gooey fence creature.

905
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,781
Science teacher.

906
00:42:01,935 --> 00:42:02,936
The dewy tense preacher?

907
00:42:04,375 --> 00:42:06,264
The dial on the...

908
00:42:06,415 --> 00:42:07,746
Oh, come on!

909
00:42:07,935 --> 00:42:09,903
Thank you, human woman!

910
00:42:10,535 --> 00:42:11,900
Sidekicks, explain to me

911
00:42:11,975 --> 00:42:13,784
the importance
of this secret file.

912
00:42:13,935 --> 00:42:15,295
There's a new
super villain in town

913
00:42:15,375 --> 00:42:17,015
and we're trying to
discover his weakness.

914
00:42:17,095 --> 00:42:18,096
Oh...

915
00:42:22,415 --> 00:42:24,258
"Poopypants."

916
00:42:25,495 --> 00:42:27,623
<i>Hallelujah</i>

917
00:42:27,775 --> 00:42:29,584
<i>Hallelujah</i>

918
00:42:29,735 --> 00:42:31,942
<i>His name is Poopypants
We found his weakness</i>

919
00:42:32,095 --> 00:42:34,097
<i>Hallelujah</i>

920
00:42:34,615 --> 00:42:37,983
<i>He wants to rid the world</i>

921
00:42:38,175 --> 00:42:40,496
<i>Of laughter</i>

922
00:42:40,655 --> 00:42:41,656
<i>Forever</i>

923
00:42:41,815 --> 00:42:42,816
<i>And ever</i>

924
00:42:42,975 --> 00:42:44,022
<i>We will defeat him</i>

925
00:42:44,175 --> 00:42:47,463
<i>Hallelujah Hallelujah</i>

926
00:42:49,135 --> 00:42:54,141
<i>Poopypants</i>

927
00:43:00,295 --> 00:43:01,820
Captain?
You forgetting something?

928
00:43:01,975 --> 00:43:04,342
Oh, look at that.
They came off again.

929
00:43:06,335 --> 00:43:07,541
Hey there, kiddo.

930
00:43:07,695 --> 00:43:09,265
First day for Professor P.

931
00:43:09,455 --> 00:43:11,378
Can you tell me where
the lunch is consumed?

932
00:43:13,175 --> 00:43:14,540
What's going on with your face?

933
00:43:14,695 --> 00:43:15,696
Are you choking?

934
00:43:15,855 --> 00:43:17,016
Do you need to sneeze?

935
00:43:18,455 --> 00:43:19,820
I see, I see.

936
00:43:19,975 --> 00:43:22,979
Got a case of
the giggles' huh? That's fun.

937
00:43:23,175 --> 00:43:25,781
Well, I've got
just the remedy for that.

938
00:43:27,175 --> 00:43:29,064
In the cage. Now!
Why?

939
00:43:29,215 --> 00:43:30,819
Because I hate
laughter and children...

940
00:43:31,015 --> 00:43:33,063
and I've got a cage
in a briefcase!

941
00:43:34,335 --> 00:43:36,861
Okay, well, have a nice day.

942
00:43:37,015 --> 00:43:38,858
Now what's for lunch?

943
00:43:44,335 --> 00:43:46,702
Excuse me, could you explain
to me why this is funny?

944
00:43:46,855 --> 00:43:48,698
You! Why is everyone laughing?

945
00:43:49,015 --> 00:43:52,542
Uh, you're asking
the wrong dude.

946
00:43:52,815 --> 00:43:56,740
<i>"Captain Underpants
and the Perilous Plot of...</i>

947
00:43:56,895 --> 00:43:58,738
<i>"Professor Poem/pants."</i>

948
00:44:02,735 --> 00:44:04,151
Oh, What's happening?

949
00:44:04,175 --> 00:44:05,904
I'm hyperventilating.

950
00:44:06,095 --> 00:44:07,256
Esteemed members

951
00:44:07,375 --> 00:44:09,423
of the Nobel Prize Committee...

952
00:44:09,575 --> 00:44:11,657
it is with great pride...

953
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,499
that I present to you...

954
00:44:13,655 --> 00:44:17,376
the Sizerator 2000!

955
00:44:17,495 --> 00:44:18,576
- Oh.
- Ooh.

956
00:44:18,775 --> 00:44:21,699
Behold, we can smallify.

957
00:44:23,895 --> 00:44:26,341
No more traffic jams.

958
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:28,736
And conversely, largify.

959
00:44:34,055 --> 00:44:36,023
Look at how big this hot dog is.

960
00:44:36,575 --> 00:44:40,296
Going to need a lot of mustard
for this frankfurter!

961
00:44:42,055 --> 00:44:45,616
The Nobel Peace Prize
in Inventing Stuff goes to...

962
00:44:46,015 --> 00:44:47,062
um,

963
00:44:47,135 --> 00:44:48,136
Professor...

964
00:44:50,455 --> 00:44:52,105
ls that really your name?

965
00:44:52,255 --> 00:44:54,383
It's not, like,
some kind of joke?

966
00:44:54,535 --> 00:44:56,424
No. It's not, like, a joke.

967
00:44:56,575 --> 00:44:59,419
Ifs a traditional name
in New Swissland.

968
00:45:00,095 --> 00:45:02,063
Am I pronouncing it right?

969
00:45:02,215 --> 00:45:04,138
Poopypants?

970
00:45:04,255 --> 00:45:07,304
More or less. Except
the emphasis is on the "poop."

971
00:45:08,975 --> 00:45:10,386
Why are you laughing?

972
00:45:10,575 --> 00:45:13,465
I've invented a shrinking
and enlarging ray!

973
00:45:13,615 --> 00:45:14,901
I should be famous!

974
00:45:15,055 --> 00:45:18,457
I should be dating models
twice my size...

975
00:45:18,615 --> 00:45:20,583
and doing the talk show circuit!

976
00:45:20,735 --> 00:45:23,136
I should be protecting
baby seals as a cause...

977
00:45:23,335 --> 00:45:25,906
that I say I care about,
but not really!

978
00:45:26,055 --> 00:45:28,137
This guy is too much!

979
00:45:32,455 --> 00:45:33,980
Stop! Stop laughing!

980
00:45:34,135 --> 00:45:35,182
No, stop it!
Okay.

981
00:45:35,575 --> 00:45:37,339
Phew! Oh...

982
00:45:37,455 --> 00:45:39,617
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

983
00:45:39,815 --> 00:45:41,305
Here. Take the award.

984
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:45,425
It's really fun
to say Poopypants.

985
00:45:46,775 --> 00:45:49,665
You keep your stupid award!
I don't want it anymore.

986
00:45:49,775 --> 00:45:51,982
Oh, and one more thing...

987
00:45:56,335 --> 00:45:58,417
On behalf
of the Nobel Prize committee,

988
00:45:58,495 --> 00:46:00,099
please accept our apology.

989
00:46:00,255 --> 00:46:02,986
And could you change me
back now please?

990
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:04,311
Why don't you go on and invent

991
00:46:04,335 --> 00:46:06,019
your own shrinking
and enlarging ray...

992
00:46:06,215 --> 00:46:08,456
if you think you're so smart?

993
00:46:13,375 --> 00:46:15,662
How much of that was out loud?

994
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:18,341
Extra! Extra!
Get our latest issue!

995
00:46:18,495 --> 00:46:21,339
<i>Captain Underpants
and the Perilous Plot</i>

996
00:46:21,455 --> 00:46:23,457
<i>of Professor Poopypants.</i>

997
00:46:23,615 --> 00:46:25,185
Oh, no.

998
00:46:26,695 --> 00:46:29,221
There you are. I've been
looking all over for you.

999
00:46:29,855 --> 00:46:32,381
Hmm. How many A's
are there in "Tra-la-laaa?"

1000
00:46:32,575 --> 00:46:34,543
What?
<i>I'll</i> just go with 11.

1001
00:46:34,695 --> 00:46:36,663
Enjoying your
first day, professor?

1002
00:46:36,815 --> 00:46:38,704
The complete opposite, actually.

1003
00:46:38,855 --> 00:46:41,176
Look at what these
little monsters have created!

1004
00:46:41,895 --> 00:46:45,866
We must lock them up,
probably, like, forever!

1005
00:46:46,055 --> 00:46:47,056
Hmm.

1006
00:46:47,975 --> 00:46:49,340
Oh, my.

1007
00:46:49,495 --> 00:46:50,826
This is not a comic.

1008
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:53,503
This is a history book.

1009
00:46:53,575 --> 00:46:54,701
What?

1010
00:46:54,815 --> 00:46:57,022
And as such, it should be
taught in every classroom.

1011
00:46:57,175 --> 00:46:58,540
And you yourself
must teach it...

1012
00:46:58,695 --> 00:47:01,744
because that is how good it is.

1013
00:47:01,935 --> 00:47:03,335
I don't understand.
I thought, like,

1014
00:47:03,375 --> 00:47:05,059
we'd be on the same page here.

1015
00:47:05,855 --> 00:47:08,062
What page is that?
I'm on page 9, here.

1016
00:47:08,215 --> 00:47:09,216
It's fantastic.

1017
00:47:09,375 --> 00:47:10,376
Look, look.

1018
00:47:10,535 --> 00:47:11,911
<i>It's about
this evil science teacher...</i>

1019
00:47:11,935 --> 00:47:13,937
<i>who looks a lot like you,
by the way.</i>

1020
00:47:14,095 --> 00:47:16,223
<i>And he wanted to
rid the world of laughter...</i>

1021
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:17,935
<i>but he couldn't figure out
how to do It.</i>

1022
00:47:18,615 --> 00:47:20,822
<i>Even worse, I! seemed like
everywhere he went,</i>

1023
00:47:20,895 --> 00:47:22,863
<i>people were having fun
and laughing.</i>

1024
00:47:23,575 --> 00:47:25,577
<i>It just was infuriating.</i>

1025
00:47:25,935 --> 00:47:29,098
<i>But then, he discovered
someone who wasn't.</i>

1026
00:47:30,615 --> 00:47:32,026
Why is it funny?

1027
00:47:32,415 --> 00:47:34,782
Anti-Humor Boy!

1028
00:47:36,575 --> 00:47:38,543
And then the professor says,
"Very interesting."

1029
00:47:38,975 --> 00:47:40,386
That's my voice for him.

1030
00:47:40,535 --> 00:47:42,458
Wait, wait, wait. Gimme that.

1031
00:47:42,615 --> 00:47:44,743
That's no Anti-Humor Boy.

1032
00:47:44,935 --> 00:47:48,576
That's the suck up from class.

1033
00:47:49,415 --> 00:47:51,417
Very interesting.

1034
00:47:52,815 --> 00:47:54,783
You boys
don't even realize it...

1035
00:47:54,935 --> 00:47:57,666
but your silly comic book
just helped me figure out...

1036
00:47:57,815 --> 00:48:00,944
how to wipe out laughter
on the... Oof!

1037
00:48:01,135 --> 00:48:02,500
Out of the road, bozo!

1038
00:48:02,655 --> 00:48:03,861
Hey, watch where you're going!

1039
00:48:03,935 --> 00:48:05,619
You just hit
Professor Poopypants.

1040
00:48:05,775 --> 00:48:07,425
Poopypants?

1041
00:48:07,495 --> 00:48:09,099
That's not funny!
That's not funny!

1042
00:48:09,295 --> 00:48:11,059
Ever heard of the sidewalk?

1043
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:14,418
Oh, if I had insurance,
you'd be in... Ow!

1044
00:48:15,095 --> 00:48:17,302
I'll admit that was surprising.

1045
00:48:17,495 --> 00:48:18,496
Wow.

1046
00:48:18,575 --> 00:48:20,623
That actually
worked out for once.

1047
00:48:20,775 --> 00:48:22,300
Good job, Captain Underpants.

1048
00:48:22,455 --> 00:48:24,139
At your service, sidekicks.

1049
00:48:24,295 --> 00:48:25,899
Now where was I?

1050
00:48:25,975 --> 00:48:28,296
We should probably
get back to class, huh?

1051
00:48:28,455 --> 00:48:30,298
Yeah, we probably should.

1052
00:48:32,655 --> 00:48:33,751
Excuse me. Pardon me.
If you could just...

1053
00:48:33,775 --> 00:48:34,815
Watch your feet.
Excuse me.

1054
00:48:34,855 --> 00:48:36,266
Sorry. Thank you.
Oh, hey, Todd.

1055
00:48:36,615 --> 00:48:38,265
Now, let me ask you something.

1056
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,656
If you could
control your principal...

1057
00:48:40,815 --> 00:48:41,816
what would you do?

1058
00:48:41,975 --> 00:48:44,706
Shh.
It's starting. It's starting.

1059
00:49:35,855 --> 00:49:37,191
I just wanna make sure you apply

1060
00:49:37,215 --> 00:49:38,865
the extra credit
to next semester.

1061
00:49:39,055 --> 00:49:41,217
I won't be needing it
this semester, of course.

1062
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:42,376
Oh, yeah. Sure, yeah.

1063
00:49:42,495 --> 00:49:43,751
Whatever floats
your boat, Melvin.

1064
00:49:43,775 --> 00:49:44,981
Excuse me?

1065
00:49:45,135 --> 00:49:46,819
Can I please get
an ice cream sandwich?

1066
00:49:47,015 --> 00:49:50,462
Yeah, scram, okay?
We're closed for Ebola.

1067
00:49:52,655 --> 00:49:54,464
Okay, just a quick check

1068
00:49:54,535 --> 00:49:56,139
to make sure
that we're connected.

1069
00:49:56,295 --> 00:49:58,138
Mmm-hmm. Okay.
We're sure that's safe?

1070
00:50:02,055 --> 00:50:04,899
<i>And now,
some classic funny bloopers!</i>

1071
00:50:07,055 --> 00:50:09,342
Ah. That's a good one.
Oh, this one's my favorite.

1072
00:50:09,975 --> 00:50:12,023
I'm sorry.
Why are you showing me this?

1073
00:50:12,135 --> 00:50:13,341
Ow.

1074
00:50:14,415 --> 00:50:15,746
Come on, that was funny!

1075
00:50:15,815 --> 00:50:17,977
That child walked
right into that rake.

1076
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:21,066
I'm bored! What else is on?

1077
00:50:21,215 --> 00:50:24,856
Fascinating.
Computer, scan.

1078
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:27,706
I don't believe it.

1079
00:50:27,895 --> 00:50:28,895
You know, I suspected

1080
00:50:28,935 --> 00:50:31,381
something smaller than normal,
but this...

1081
00:50:31,855 --> 00:50:33,698
This.
What? What is it?

1082
00:50:33,895 --> 00:50:37,104
I can't find it.
Your Hahaguffawchuckleamalus!

1083
00:50:37,415 --> 00:50:38,576
You don't have one!

1084
00:50:41,615 --> 00:50:43,219
I don't get it.
Exactly.

1085
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:47,778
You have no sense of humor
like a chair or a supermodel.

1086
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:51,576
Melvin, with your brain
and my brain together...

1087
00:50:51,735 --> 00:50:54,102
we can finally wipe out laughter

1088
00:50:54,175 --> 00:50:56,382
for once and for all!

1089
00:50:57,615 --> 00:51:01,097
So George and Harold
want a supervillain...

1090
00:51:01,455 --> 00:51:05,619
well, ask and ye shall receive!

1091
00:51:07,375 --> 00:51:09,059
I hereby declare...

1092
00:51:09,215 --> 00:51:11,297
the Jerome Horwitz
art program...

1093
00:51:12,815 --> 00:51:14,465
reinstated!

1094
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:19,656
Oh...

1095
00:51:19,735 --> 00:51:20,975
After you, sir.

1096
00:51:34,815 --> 00:51:36,499
Ooh, what if we...
I'm already on it.

1097
00:51:36,655 --> 00:51:38,145
Oh, this is gonna be epic!

1098
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:41,898
Come on, Captain, draw!

1099
00:51:41,975 --> 00:51:44,182
Move your hand
in the shape of a person!

1100
00:51:44,335 --> 00:51:46,144
Why does it look like a chicken?

1101
00:51:46,295 --> 00:51:48,423
This whole visual
storytelling thing is hard!

1102
00:51:48,495 --> 00:51:49,496
Oh, that's good.

1103
00:51:49,575 --> 00:51:51,020
Here, these need words.

1104
00:51:51,335 --> 00:51:52,496
Hey, sidekicks...

1105
00:51:53,135 --> 00:51:54,500
why are we doing this again?

1106
00:51:54,655 --> 00:51:56,862
Well, we're making
school fun again.

1107
00:51:57,015 --> 00:51:59,177
You know, "free the children."

1108
00:51:59,335 --> 00:52:01,151
Hey, hey! What if we put
this panel right here?

1109
00:52:01,175 --> 00:52:02,176
Oh, yes! Yes, yes.

1110
00:52:02,295 --> 00:52:04,024
Ah, yes. Of course.

1111
00:52:04,335 --> 00:52:05,336
Fun.

1112
00:52:05,495 --> 00:52:06,542
On it!

1113
00:52:06,615 --> 00:52:07,616
Ha-ha!

1114
00:52:14,455 --> 00:52:15,456
Uh...

1115
00:52:15,655 --> 00:52:17,020
Where'd everybody go?

1116
00:52:23,015 --> 00:52:25,017
Where did this even come from?

1117
00:52:25,135 --> 00:52:26,136
Hey!

1118
00:52:26,215 --> 00:52:27,775
Oh, hey, sidekicks.
Glad you could join.

1119
00:52:27,855 --> 00:52:29,061
How did you even do this?

1120
00:52:29,135 --> 00:52:30,671
I thought you said
you were looking after the...

1121
00:52:30,695 --> 00:52:32,151
Oh, my goodness!
Is that a Ferris wheel?

1122
00:52:32,175 --> 00:52:33,540
Well, of course it is!

1123
00:52:33,615 --> 00:52:35,697
It came
with the carnival I ordered.

1124
00:52:37,175 --> 00:52:39,826
This cotton candy
makes me feel powerful!

1125
00:52:41,815 --> 00:52:43,340
Hey, uh,
where are all the teachers?

1126
00:52:43,495 --> 00:52:44,542
Detention.

1127
00:52:44,815 --> 00:52:47,022
They have a real
attitude problem.

1128
00:52:47,375 --> 00:52:49,218
Sure beats having Krupp around!

1129
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:52,697
Oh, yeah. Krupp would totally
lose his mind if he saw this.

1130
00:52:52,855 --> 00:52:54,380
Step right up!

1131
00:52:54,535 --> 00:52:56,981
Who'll be the first
to dunk the principal?

1132
00:52:57,055 --> 00:52:58,055
No!

1133
00:52:59,175 --> 00:53:00,825
I'm drowning!

1134
00:53:02,415 --> 00:53:03,416
Tra-la...

1135
00:53:03,495 --> 00:53:05,031
All right, that's enough.
Recess is over.

1136
00:53:05,055 --> 00:53:06,102
Ah, come on!

1137
00:53:06,215 --> 00:53:07,216
Just one more ride!
Whoa!

1138
00:53:08,095 --> 00:53:09,904
Hey, watch it!
What is this, a carnival?

1139
00:53:10,055 --> 00:53:11,659
I hate carnivals!

1140
00:53:11,815 --> 00:53:13,943
Oh, this looks fun!
How do we play?

1141
00:53:15,015 --> 00:53:16,426
Hold your fire!

1142
00:53:17,935 --> 00:53:18,936
What is happening?

1143
00:53:19,095 --> 00:53:20,096
Who wants ice cream?

1144
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,586
Ice cream!

1145
00:53:21,775 --> 00:53:23,815
What are we gonna do?
We can't keep this up forever.

1146
00:53:23,855 --> 00:53:25,857
We have to! We'll just
take shifts watching him.

1147
00:53:26,015 --> 00:53:27,346
I'll take today.
You take tonight.

1148
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:28,735
Sugar!

1149
00:53:30,935 --> 00:53:31,936
Sugar!

1150
00:53:33,935 --> 00:53:35,937
Harold, I really
want some sugar.

1151
00:53:36,095 --> 00:53:37,381
Me too.

1152
00:53:39,095 --> 00:53:40,460
We made the wrong choice!

1153
00:53:40,615 --> 00:53:42,458
This did not solve anything!

1154
00:53:42,615 --> 00:53:43,975
Hey, sidekicks!

1155
00:53:44,455 --> 00:53:45,945
Check this out!

1156
00:53:46,855 --> 00:53:48,744
Geronimo!

1157
00:53:48,895 --> 00:53:49,896
No!

1158
00:53:53,775 --> 00:53:55,140
This way!

1159
00:53:55,295 --> 00:53:57,138
Field trip, anyone?

1160
00:53:59,095 --> 00:54:00,221
No, no, no!

1161
00:54:00,935 --> 00:54:03,302
Nothing's more fun than fire!

1162
00:54:03,455 --> 00:54:04,980
Except being on...

1163
00:54:06,295 --> 00:54:07,660
Fire!

1164
00:54:10,215 --> 00:54:11,296
What is happening?

1165
00:54:12,655 --> 00:54:14,498
Tra-la-laaaa!

1166
00:54:19,975 --> 00:54:22,342
Now, this is
how you run a school!

1167
00:54:24,935 --> 00:54:26,824
Free the children!

1168
00:54:29,615 --> 00:54:30,616
Wait a minute.

1169
00:54:33,815 --> 00:54:34,816
What the...

1170
00:54:36,655 --> 00:54:37,816
How did this...

1171
00:54:40,655 --> 00:54:42,145
I don't understand.

1172
00:54:42,615 --> 00:54:44,185
Help!
What the...

1173
00:54:46,415 --> 00:54:47,701
You...

1174
00:54:48,415 --> 00:54:50,179
You two.

1175
00:54:51,495 --> 00:54:53,179
Your friendship...

1176
00:54:53,935 --> 00:54:57,826
is no more.

1177
00:55:40,055 --> 00:55:41,056
What?

1178
00:55:46,375 --> 00:55:47,376
George!

1179
00:55:47,695 --> 00:55:48,742
Harold!

1180
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:52,416
Harold! Come back!

1181
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:55,738
George, I'm right here!
I'm right here!

1182
00:55:55,895 --> 00:55:59,217
Oh, no! No, no!
Don't leave me!

1183
00:55:59,375 --> 00:56:01,537
I won't! I won't, George!

1184
00:56:01,695 --> 00:56:02,695
Harold!

1185
00:56:02,735 --> 00:56:04,260
No, no! Wait, wait! Stop!

1186
00:56:04,415 --> 00:56:06,065
George!

1187
00:56:06,215 --> 00:56:08,058
George!

1188
00:56:29,295 --> 00:56:32,060
This thing is amazing,
Professor P.

1189
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:33,302
You could probably solve

1190
00:56:33,415 --> 00:56:35,015
world hunger
with an invention like this.

1191
00:56:35,135 --> 00:56:37,866
Pass!
More importantly...

1192
00:56:38,135 --> 00:56:39,739
how do I look?

1193
00:56:39,895 --> 00:56:42,626
Just like you do in this comic!

1194
00:56:42,775 --> 00:56:44,777
Good! Now,
hands off the merchandise,

1195
00:56:44,895 --> 00:56:46,818
and go fetch
your little toilet, okay?

1196
00:56:48,135 --> 00:56:49,899
I call it "The Turbo..."

1197
00:56:50,055 --> 00:56:52,422
Yeah, yeah. Couple of
gold stars for you, kiddo.

1198
00:56:52,975 --> 00:56:56,980
Let the Poopageddon begin!

1199
00:56:59,935 --> 00:57:01,824
Whoo-ee!

1200
00:57:06,255 --> 00:57:09,145
What?
Oh, you've gotta be joking me!

1201
00:57:09,495 --> 00:57:13,580
Poopypants has no gas!
You can't write this stuff.

1202
00:57:14,575 --> 00:57:16,100
Where would a burgeoning villain

1203
00:57:16,175 --> 00:57:17,779
find unlimited power?

1204
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:20,666
True power comes from within.

1205
00:57:20,815 --> 00:57:22,146
No, it doesn't, Melvin!

1206
00:57:22,295 --> 00:57:23,295
That's on stupid posters!

1207
00:57:23,335 --> 00:57:24,336
Okay.

1208
00:57:24,455 --> 00:57:26,503
It comes
from enormous energy sources!

1209
00:57:26,615 --> 00:57:27,855
A nuclear waste dump.

1210
00:57:28,015 --> 00:57:29,016
I see where you're going.

1211
00:57:29,095 --> 00:57:30,665
A poisonous chemical factory.

1212
00:57:30,855 --> 00:57:34,462
Or perhaps
a place even more toxic!

1213
00:57:37,775 --> 00:57:39,140
Whoo!
These leftovers got a kick.

1214
00:57:41,695 --> 00:57:43,982
Oh, it's a powerful smell.

1215
00:57:51,855 --> 00:57:54,506
Back in business, baby!

1216
00:57:55,015 --> 00:57:57,700
Memorize these elements...

1217
00:57:57,855 --> 00:57:59,983
Oxygen. Beryllium.

1218
00:58:00,175 --> 00:58:02,018
Boringillium.

1219
00:58:02,175 --> 00:58:03,700
Lameium.

1220
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:05,141
Snoronium.

1221
00:58:15,455 --> 00:58:17,503
Excuse me, everybody,
there's a giant...

1222
00:58:17,695 --> 00:58:19,191
Do not interrupt
while I'm reading

1223
00:58:19,215 --> 00:58:20,865
monotone from my textbook!

1224
00:58:21,015 --> 00:58:23,063
But the toilet!

1225
00:58:23,215 --> 00:58:24,216
Ugh.

1226
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:26,184
Just go.

1227
00:58:27,575 --> 00:58:28,576
Harold?

1228
00:58:29,415 --> 00:58:30,416
George?

1229
00:58:49,575 --> 00:58:51,418
Students and faculty

1230
00:58:51,535 --> 00:58:54,539
<i>of Jerome Horwitz Elementary...</i>

1231
00:58:54,935 --> 00:59:00,101
<i>the world, as you know it,
is about to go extinct.</i>

1232
00:59:00,255 --> 00:59:04,021
And a new world order
is about to rise!

1233
00:59:04,175 --> 00:59:05,700
One that is, you know, honestly

1234
00:59:05,775 --> 00:59:07,459
pretty similar
to the old world order...

1235
00:59:07,615 --> 00:59:10,937
except for one tiny detail...

1236
00:59:13,375 --> 00:59:14,456
Melvin?

1237
00:59:14,615 --> 00:59:16,265
Comin' atcha!

1238
00:59:16,415 --> 00:59:18,782
Powered by
Melvin's unique neurology...

1239
00:59:18,935 --> 00:59:23,099
I will successfully disable
the Hahaguffawchuckleamalus...

1240
00:59:23,255 --> 00:59:27,260
of every single child at
Jerome Horwitz Elementary.

1241
00:59:27,415 --> 00:59:31,136
<i>For I, Professor Poopypants...</i>

1242
00:59:32,975 --> 00:59:34,579
Yeah, it's a funny name.

1243
00:59:35,455 --> 00:59:38,618
It just makes you
laugh and laugh, right?

1244
00:59:41,295 --> 00:59:42,296
Get down!

1245
00:59:45,735 --> 00:59:47,817
Still give you the chuckles now?

1246
00:59:47,935 --> 00:59:49,380
Poopypants!

1247
00:59:49,575 --> 00:59:50,986
I don't get it.

1248
00:59:51,135 --> 00:59:52,216
Why is that funny?

1249
00:59:52,415 --> 00:59:53,416
Perfect!

1250
00:59:53,575 --> 00:59:56,499
Finally!
You're speaking my language!

1251
00:59:56,655 --> 00:59:58,100
Oh, no. This is bad.

1252
00:59:58,295 --> 00:59:59,421
This is seriously bad.

1253
00:59:59,495 --> 01:00:01,577
I mean,
a world without laughter?

1254
01:00:01,735 --> 01:00:03,375
George, if he destroys
our sense of humor,

1255
01:00:03,415 --> 01:00:04,496
he destroys us!

1256
01:00:04,655 --> 01:00:07,340
Imagine how boring
our comics will be.

1257
01:00:08,135 --> 01:00:09,944
<i>Captain Underpants
and the Purchase</i>

1258
01:00:10,015 --> 01:00:11,585
<i>of the Sensible Beige Pants.</i>

1259
01:00:11,735 --> 01:00:15,979
<i>Captain Underpants
Eats All of His Falafel.</i>

1260
01:00:16,135 --> 01:00:18,661
<i>Captain Underpants
Watches Cement Dry.</i>

1261
01:00:21,255 --> 01:00:22,671
And would the creators of

1262
01:00:22,695 --> 01:00:25,824
this absolutely
hilarious comic book...

1263
01:00:25,975 --> 01:00:29,184
please come out, come out,
wherever you are!

1264
01:00:29,335 --> 01:00:31,019
You're next.

1265
01:00:35,495 --> 01:00:37,179
Okay, we have to stop him.

1266
01:00:37,535 --> 01:00:39,185
We've gotta find a way
to unplug Melvin.

1267
01:00:39,375 --> 01:00:40,376
Yeah.

1268
01:00:40,695 --> 01:00:43,221
But how do we get to him
without Poopypants seeing us?

1269
01:00:45,455 --> 01:00:47,457
What are you two doing together?

1270
01:00:50,695 --> 01:00:52,299
Are you in there?

1271
01:00:52,495 --> 01:00:54,975
Oh...
Maybe you're hiding here.

1272
01:00:57,575 --> 01:00:59,623
Oh, sorry.
Are you stuck on hold?

1273
01:00:59,735 --> 01:01:00,736
Mmm-hmm.

1274
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:03,217
Oh, totally hate
when that happens.

1275
01:01:03,375 --> 01:01:04,536
Well, good luck with that.

1276
01:01:04,735 --> 01:01:06,464
Now, where are
those two little...

1277
01:01:06,655 --> 01:01:08,737
Stand down, Poopypants!

1278
01:01:08,895 --> 01:01:10,056
What is happening?

1279
01:01:10,215 --> 01:01:11,740
I hope this works.

1280
01:01:11,895 --> 01:01:13,420
Tra-la-laaa!

1281
01:01:13,535 --> 01:01:14,661
Ow! Ow!

1282
01:01:16,015 --> 01:01:17,831
Keep standing down.
I'm just gonna be a second.

1283
01:01:17,855 --> 01:01:19,220
Ow.

1284
01:01:19,815 --> 01:01:21,817
I bet he thought
that was going to be cooler.

1285
01:01:21,975 --> 01:01:23,739
Oh, boy. Here goes nothing.

1286
01:01:23,855 --> 01:01:25,016
Ha-ha!

1287
01:01:25,215 --> 01:01:26,740
Prepare to be vanquished...

1288
01:01:26,895 --> 01:01:28,260
and justice to be served

1289
01:01:28,375 --> 01:01:31,026
on a piping hot
platter of freedom!

1290
01:01:31,175 --> 01:01:32,745
With a side order of liberty...

1291
01:01:32,895 --> 01:01:36,616
and a super-sized cup
filled with freedom also!

1292
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:39,261
Impressive use
of fast-food analogies,

1293
01:01:39,375 --> 01:01:41,582
you giant baby with a cape on!

1294
01:01:41,775 --> 01:01:43,106
Let's do this.

1295
01:02:02,255 --> 01:02:04,257
Freeze! The following sequence
contains scenes...

1296
01:02:04,415 --> 01:02:05,751
that are so intense,
horrific, and violent...

1297
01:02:05,775 --> 01:02:06,776
And expensive.

1298
01:02:06,935 --> 01:02:09,111
That we can only show it
using a technology known as...

1299
01:02:09,135 --> 01:02:11,263
<i>Flip-O-Rama!</i>

1300
01:02:11,415 --> 01:02:12,541
<i>Take it away, Harold.</i>

1301
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:14,191
Okay, first Professor Poopypants

1302
01:02:14,215 --> 01:02:15,391
gave Captain Underpants
the boot.

1303
01:02:15,415 --> 01:02:16,701
Foot! Foot! Ow!

1304
01:02:16,895 --> 01:02:18,511
Then he made
an Underpants sandwich.

1305
01:02:18,535 --> 01:02:19,871
Punch, punch! Punch, punch!

1306
01:02:19,895 --> 01:02:22,111
And then, they played
a friendly game of paddleball!

1307
01:02:22,135 --> 01:02:23,899
Oh, no!

1308
01:02:24,055 --> 01:02:25,056
Darn.

1309
01:02:25,135 --> 01:02:27,058
Okay, what's next?
Oh, yes!

1310
01:02:27,215 --> 01:02:30,059
Then, Poopypants summoned
an army of dolphins...

1311
01:02:30,215 --> 01:02:31,271
Wait, what?
Why are you always

1312
01:02:31,295 --> 01:02:32,551
sneaking dolphins
into the movie?

1313
01:02:32,575 --> 01:02:33,871
What do you have
against dolphins anyway?

1314
01:02:33,895 --> 01:02:35,191
I don't have nothing
against dolphins,

1315
01:02:35,215 --> 01:02:36,951
- it just didn't happen!
- Well, so what'?

1316
01:02:36,975 --> 01:02:39,626
We get to say what happened.
It's the Flip-O-Rama.

1317
01:02:39,775 --> 01:02:41,777
I like dolphins.
The dolphins are in.

1318
01:02:42,095 --> 01:02:43,871
Fine, all right.
Let's just keep going.

1319
01:02:43,895 --> 01:02:45,031
- You sure?
- Yep, positive.

1320
01:02:45,055 --> 01:02:46,055
Thank you.

1321
01:02:46,135 --> 01:02:48,471
- Anyway, Poopypants didn't realize it...
- Quiet five, quiet five.

1322
01:02:48,495 --> 01:02:50,782
But George and Harold's plan
was working out perfectly.

1323
01:02:50,935 --> 01:02:52,871
So, they
shot themselves to the top

1324
01:02:52,895 --> 01:02:54,340
of the Turbo Toilet 2000!

1325
01:02:54,495 --> 01:02:56,816
To keep things dramatic,
they didn't quite make it.

1326
01:02:57,015 --> 01:02:58,744
And then...
And then...

1327
01:02:58,975 --> 01:02:59,975
And then...

1328
01:03:00,015 --> 01:03:01,585
What happened
to the Flip-O-Rama?

1329
01:03:01,735 --> 01:03:02,861
I ran outta paper.

1330
01:03:06,735 --> 01:03:08,703
Hey, Melvin!
Take that thing off your head.

1331
01:03:08,855 --> 01:03:09,856
We gotta stop Poopypants!

1332
01:03:10,175 --> 01:03:11,700
Professor Poopypants!

1333
01:03:11,775 --> 01:03:14,016
George and Harold
are trying to stop you!

1334
01:03:15,335 --> 01:03:17,099
You are just so annoying!

1335
01:03:18,335 --> 01:03:21,259
So, you two
little numbskulls thought

1336
01:03:21,375 --> 01:03:22,456
you could distract me...

1337
01:03:22,615 --> 01:03:25,698
with this idiotic, naked man.
Am I right?

1338
01:03:25,855 --> 01:03:27,823
I'm not naked!

1339
01:03:27,975 --> 01:03:32,185
Any final words before this
whole revenge thing goes down?

1340
01:03:34,055 --> 01:03:35,500
Yeah, wait, wait. Listen.

1341
01:03:35,655 --> 01:03:38,056
We apologize
for making fun of your name.

1342
01:03:38,215 --> 01:03:40,536
I mean, that was just wrong.

1343
01:03:40,695 --> 01:03:44,541
Yeah, we're sorry.
The truth is. Professor P...

1344
01:03:44,695 --> 01:03:46,060
you have probably, like,

1345
01:03:46,135 --> 01:03:47,978
the greatest name
we've ever heard.

1346
01:03:48,535 --> 01:03:50,503
I mean, George, imagine
if we had names like that.

1347
01:03:50,695 --> 01:03:52,299
Oh, that would be so cool!

1348
01:03:52,455 --> 01:03:54,059
Okay, wait, let's do it.
Let's try it.

1349
01:03:54,495 --> 01:03:56,896
Oh, I would be
Fluffy Toiletnose.

1350
01:03:57,055 --> 01:04:00,855
Yeah! I would be
Sir Cheeseball Wafflefanny.

1351
01:04:01,015 --> 01:04:02,191
Yeah, sure. You're a knight.

1352
01:04:02,215 --> 01:04:03,216
This is so good!

1353
01:04:03,735 --> 01:04:04,736
I wanna change mine.

1354
01:04:04,895 --> 01:04:07,262
I'd be
Buttcheeks von Stinkelsberg.

1355
01:04:09,415 --> 01:04:10,655
Stinkelsberg.

1356
01:04:11,255 --> 01:04:13,656
Yeah, those are all
really silly names,

1357
01:04:13,735 --> 01:04:15,055
but there's
nothing funny about...

1358
01:04:15,095 --> 01:04:17,826
Professor
Pee-Pee Diarrheastein

1359
01:04:17,895 --> 01:04:20,341
Poopypants Esquire!

1360
01:04:21,055 --> 01:04:24,741
Sir, are you saying
your full name is...

1361
01:04:24,935 --> 01:04:28,781
Pee-Pee Diarrheastein
Poopypants Esquire?

1362
01:04:28,855 --> 01:04:29,856
Uh-huh.

1363
01:04:32,935 --> 01:04:34,380
Stop it! Stop laughing!

1364
01:04:34,535 --> 01:04:36,344
Come on! Listen, your problem

1365
01:04:36,415 --> 01:04:38,065
isn't that people laugh at you.

1366
01:04:38,215 --> 01:04:40,582
Your problem is that
you can't laugh at yourself.

1367
01:04:40,735 --> 01:04:43,261
Oh, really, Oprah?
Is that my problem?

1368
01:04:43,455 --> 01:04:45,583
Well, your problem is this...

1369
01:04:53,455 --> 01:04:54,616
No!

1370
01:04:55,775 --> 01:04:58,301
Oh, I hope
you enjoyed your years

1371
01:04:58,375 --> 01:05:00,457
of laughter and merriment...

1372
01:05:00,615 --> 01:05:04,256
because they're about
to come to an end.

1373
01:05:08,135 --> 01:05:10,979
Do you find anything funny
about me now?

1374
01:05:11,775 --> 01:05:14,221
You mean, other than your name?

1375
01:05:15,935 --> 01:05:17,937
Yes! Other than that!

1376
01:05:19,135 --> 01:05:21,103
And your hair'?

1377
01:05:21,175 --> 01:05:22,176
What?

1378
01:05:22,255 --> 01:05:23,825
My hair's cool, I thought.

1379
01:05:23,975 --> 01:05:25,659
Are you kidding me?

1380
01:05:25,815 --> 01:05:28,625
That's almost as funny as
my hair back in kindygarten!

1381
01:05:28,775 --> 01:05:30,345
Remember that afro?

1382
01:05:31,575 --> 01:05:33,577
No!
No, this can't be happening!

1383
01:05:33,655 --> 01:05:35,657
Computer, activate brain scan.

1384
01:05:38,335 --> 01:05:41,100
Let's see. The frontal lobes
look big and healthy.

1385
01:05:41,255 --> 01:05:43,019
The Hahaguffawchuckleamalus

1386
01:05:43,095 --> 01:05:45,826
looks all shrimpy,
so, what gives?

1387
01:05:48,495 --> 01:05:49,496
It can't be!

1388
01:05:49,655 --> 01:05:51,783
Their Hahaguffawchuckleamaluses,

1389
01:05:51,855 --> 01:05:53,345
they're enormous!

1390
01:05:53,855 --> 01:05:54,981
I need more power.

1391
01:05:58,695 --> 01:06:00,936
Anything strike you
as funny now?

1392
01:06:01,095 --> 01:06:04,542
I'm sure
we can think of something!

1393
01:06:04,695 --> 01:06:08,017
George, I can't smile anymore.

1394
01:06:08,175 --> 01:06:09,825
No! Harold!

1395
01:06:13,855 --> 01:06:16,938
<i>One down, undone to go.</i>

1396
01:06:17,935 --> 01:06:19,141
Harold.

1397
01:06:24,775 --> 01:06:27,016
Harold. Harold,
can you hear me?

1398
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:29,059
Harold!

1399
01:06:29,895 --> 01:06:31,545
George! George, is that you?

1400
01:06:31,695 --> 01:06:32,696
Right here, buddy.

1401
01:06:33,335 --> 01:06:35,144
What's happening?
We're shrinking!

1402
01:06:35,295 --> 01:06:36,711
Now, if we don't laugh
at something soon,

1403
01:06:36,735 --> 01:06:37,896
we may never laugh again.

1404
01:06:38,055 --> 01:06:40,183
Oh, no! What do we do?
What do we do? What do we do?

1405
01:06:40,335 --> 01:06:42,383
Well, we have to think
of something funny, okay?

1406
01:06:42,575 --> 01:06:44,498
Okay, yeah, sure.
Something funny.

1407
01:06:45,895 --> 01:06:46,896
Anything?

1408
01:06:46,975 --> 01:06:48,306
No, I got nothing.
Me neither.

1409
01:06:48,495 --> 01:06:49,615
More shrinkage!

1410
01:06:50,135 --> 01:06:52,581
Okay, okay.
What did we use to find funny?

1411
01:06:52,735 --> 01:06:54,863
Mostly potty humor. Poop,
vomit, that kind of thing.

1412
01:06:55,015 --> 01:06:58,861
Really? Ugh. That is, like,
the lowest form of comedy.

1413
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:01,825
Don't you say that, Harold!
Don't you leave me!

1414
01:07:02,695 --> 01:07:04,151
Attention everyone!

1415
01:07:04,175 --> 01:07:07,099
<i>Poopypants here with a little
update on the Poopageddon.</i>

1416
01:07:07,255 --> 01:07:10,577
<i>Due to the success
of my plan thus far...</i>

1417
01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:12,578
<i>We decided to wipe out laughter</i>

1418
01:07:12,655 --> 01:07:14,419
<i>on the entire planet.</i>

1419
01:07:14,575 --> 01:07:16,339
<i>After that, you know,
I'll probably</i>

1420
01:07:16,415 --> 01:07:17,495
<i>move on to other planets...</i>

1421
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:18,576
<i>Jupiter, Mars...</i>

1422
01:07:18,775 --> 01:07:20,504
can't forget Uranus!

1423
01:07:21,335 --> 01:07:23,099
Wait. Did he just say...

1424
01:07:24,095 --> 01:07:26,097
Your anus.

1425
01:07:26,255 --> 01:07:27,256
I know!

1426
01:07:35,535 --> 01:07:36,536
Uranus!

1427
01:07:37,455 --> 01:07:40,425
Yeah, and once I'm through
with the gas giants...

1428
01:07:40,575 --> 01:07:42,543
I figure I'll go
after the other galaxies...

1429
01:07:42,695 --> 01:07:43,742
What?

1430
01:07:44,735 --> 01:07:47,545
It feels so good to laugh!

1431
01:07:50,575 --> 01:07:54,819
No, stop it! Stop laughing!
You're ruining everything!

1432
01:07:54,975 --> 01:07:57,546
Yikes!
Extra credit or survival?

1433
01:07:57,735 --> 01:07:59,146
Extra credit or survival?

1434
01:07:59,295 --> 01:08:01,138
I choose survival!

1435
01:08:12,815 --> 01:08:13,816
Uh-oh!

1436
01:08:31,655 --> 01:08:32,816
Oh, yeah!

1437
01:08:33,855 --> 01:08:34,856
Wow!

1438
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:41,138
No, how could this be happening?

1439
01:08:41,295 --> 01:08:42,342
Never underestimate

1440
01:08:42,415 --> 01:08:44,497
the power of laughter,
Poopypants!

1441
01:08:44,695 --> 01:08:46,777
Oh, that's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

1442
01:08:46,855 --> 01:08:47,856
Oh!

1443
01:08:49,695 --> 01:08:51,140
Ah! Whoa!

1444
01:09:04,455 --> 01:09:06,537
Harold! Harold, we did it!

1445
01:09:07,375 --> 01:09:08,376
Harold?

1446
01:09:08,655 --> 01:09:09,941
I think I bruised a rib.

1447
01:09:10,135 --> 01:09:11,978
Because I've never laughed
so hard in my life!

1448
01:09:16,095 --> 01:09:18,985
Oh, we'll see who's laughing
once I shrink you down...

1449
01:09:19,135 --> 01:09:21,183
where you will live
in my pocket forever...

1450
01:09:21,335 --> 01:09:23,576
amongst my
cherry-flavored lip balm...

1451
01:09:23,775 --> 01:09:25,698
my butterscotch-flavored
lip balm...

1452
01:09:25,775 --> 01:09:26,776
Oh, neato!

1453
01:09:26,855 --> 01:09:28,698
My mint-flavored
lip balm...

1454
01:09:28,855 --> 01:09:32,018
my extra-moisturized
SPF lip balm...

1455
01:09:32,175 --> 01:09:34,906
and all of my lip balms!

1456
01:09:37,775 --> 01:09:39,539
Why does one person have
so much lip balm?

1457
01:09:39,695 --> 01:09:40,696
Help!
Help!

1458
01:09:40,815 --> 01:09:42,658
Please, anyone! Help!

1459
01:09:43,015 --> 01:09:44,426
Help!

1460
01:09:52,695 --> 01:09:54,618
Ooh, I hope you can find
tiny enough pens...

1461
01:09:54,775 --> 01:09:56,857
to make your small,
little comic books with...

1462
01:09:57,015 --> 01:09:59,017
'cause you're about to
get smallified!

1463
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:10,863
Tra-la-laa!

1464
01:10:11,015 --> 01:10:12,619
I feel...

1465
01:10:13,495 --> 01:10:14,656
awesome!

1466
01:10:14,815 --> 01:10:15,862
No way!

1467
01:10:15,935 --> 01:10:17,425
He has real superpowers!

1468
01:10:17,615 --> 01:10:20,459
Oh, that is an obvious twist
that I did not see coming...

1469
01:10:20,615 --> 01:10:22,583
despite my many years
of comic book studies!

1470
01:10:22,735 --> 01:10:25,420
I have come to save the day!

1471
01:10:25,575 --> 01:10:26,736
Yay!

1472
01:10:26,895 --> 01:10:28,306
Yeah, and I've come to ruin it!

1473
01:10:28,455 --> 01:10:29,735
So back off, buddy!

1474
01:10:32,495 --> 01:10:33,496
Ha-ha!

1475
01:10:33,655 --> 01:10:34,986
Ew, that's gross!

1476
01:10:35,135 --> 01:10:36,705
Oh, there's more
where that came from.

1477
01:10:36,895 --> 01:10:39,466
Monday! Tuesday!
Wednesday! Thursday!

1478
01:10:39,975 --> 01:10:41,340
Ha-ha! Unlimited underpants!

1479
01:10:41,495 --> 01:10:44,385
I am so glad that we gave him
that superpower!

1480
01:10:46,775 --> 01:10:48,015
My Sizerator!

1481
01:10:48,335 --> 01:10:50,906
Well, it's mine now!

1482
01:10:51,215 --> 01:10:53,138
Alas!

1483
01:10:53,295 --> 01:10:57,459
The final failure
for Professor Poopypants.

1484
01:10:57,695 --> 01:10:59,140
Hmm. What does this button do?

1485
01:11:01,255 --> 01:11:03,223
Oh...

1486
01:11:03,335 --> 01:11:05,383
Well, hello down there!

1487
01:11:05,535 --> 01:11:06,536
No!

1488
01:11:06,655 --> 01:11:07,815
Must be holding it backwards.

1489
01:11:08,735 --> 01:11:10,066
Yup. That was it.

1490
01:11:10,255 --> 01:11:12,064
Wow. He is super dumb.

1491
01:11:13,615 --> 01:11:14,821
I can't reach.

1492
01:11:15,015 --> 01:11:17,382
Time to take you down
once and for all, Poopypants!

1493
01:11:17,535 --> 01:11:19,185
Buzz off!

1494
01:11:22,095 --> 01:11:23,221
Captain Underpants!

1495
01:11:23,375 --> 01:11:25,055
Fly over here
so we can make you big again!

1496
01:11:25,215 --> 01:11:26,296
Crackerjack idea.

1497
01:11:28,175 --> 01:11:29,176
George, just don't...

1498
01:11:29,295 --> 01:11:31,377
No!

1499
01:11:31,455 --> 01:11:32,575
Ha-ha!

1500
01:11:32,615 --> 01:11:35,903
Give him a big hand
for that one, everybody!

1501
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:37,581
Get him.

1502
01:11:40,695 --> 01:11:41,742
Whoops.

1503
01:11:42,215 --> 01:11:44,024
Look what I've got.

1504
01:11:44,695 --> 01:11:45,981
A tiny school

1505
01:11:46,055 --> 01:11:47,615
filled with tiny children...

1506
01:11:48,335 --> 01:11:50,542
and their tiny teachers
whose tiny salaries...

1507
01:11:50,695 --> 01:11:52,743
reflect their size and also...

1508
01:11:52,895 --> 01:11:55,705
the value society puts
on education.

1509
01:11:56,335 --> 01:11:57,575
I'll take that!

1510
01:11:57,735 --> 01:11:59,578
Oh! Then I'll take that!

1511
01:11:59,695 --> 01:12:01,106
Ow! Did you just slap me?

1512
01:12:01,255 --> 01:12:03,019
Yes, I did.
And you deserved it.

1513
01:12:03,175 --> 01:12:05,826
No, I didn't! Your hand
is huge! That hurt a lot!

1514
01:12:05,975 --> 01:12:07,136
Give it back, it's mine!

1515
01:12:07,295 --> 01:12:08,376
No! Hands off!

1516
01:12:08,535 --> 01:12:10,219
No fair! No backsies!
Give it to me!

1517
01:12:10,375 --> 01:12:11,661
Would you just give me that?

1518
01:12:11,855 --> 01:12:13,345
Now look what you've done!

1519
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:14,496
Give it!

1520
01:12:23,855 --> 01:12:25,425
George!

1521
01:12:32,055 --> 01:12:33,056
Gotcha!

1522
01:12:34,775 --> 01:12:36,379
Yeah, that's more like it!

1523
01:12:37,935 --> 01:12:39,141
Nice work, sidekicks!

1524
01:12:39,215 --> 01:12:40,944
I'll just put this back down
right here.

1525
01:12:41,095 --> 01:12:42,375
No, no, no!
Captain Underpants...

1526
01:12:43,535 --> 01:12:45,378
There we go. Back to normal...

1527
01:12:45,535 --> 01:12:46,946
like it never happened.

1528
01:12:48,375 --> 01:12:50,264
Oh, no, where'd he go?

1529
01:12:50,415 --> 01:12:51,985
You'll never catch me!

1530
01:12:52,135 --> 01:12:54,297
You can't stop
Professor Poopypants!

1531
01:12:54,895 --> 01:12:56,340
Get back here!
I can't reach!

1532
01:12:56,495 --> 01:12:57,895
Get him, Captain Underpants!

1533
01:12:57,935 --> 01:12:59,937
A bee!
Get away from me!

1534
01:13:00,095 --> 01:13:02,223
I'm free!

1535
01:13:05,055 --> 01:13:06,615
What? What the...
Why would you do that?

1536
01:13:06,735 --> 01:13:08,499
You just let
the bad guy get away!

1537
01:13:08,655 --> 01:13:11,864
Come on, guys. Pretty sure
the bee wasn't the bad guy.

1538
01:13:15,535 --> 01:13:18,266
What the heck happened here?

1539
01:13:18,615 --> 01:13:20,535
You're welcome, peace keeper!

1540
01:13:20,655 --> 01:13:22,145
Would you keep it down?

1541
01:13:31,175 --> 01:13:34,896
Did not see that coming!
Take that, Doctor Diaper!

1542
01:13:38,575 --> 01:13:40,100
I can't believe we made him.

1543
01:13:40,255 --> 01:13:42,337
And he's even dumber
in real life.

1544
01:13:43,015 --> 01:13:45,416
Oh! Look! Little dolphins!

1545
01:13:49,615 --> 01:13:51,424
We have to get rid of him,
don't we?

1546
01:13:51,575 --> 01:13:52,986
I think we do.

1547
01:13:53,135 --> 01:13:54,466
I mean,
he's a way bigger problem

1548
01:13:54,535 --> 01:13:55,866
than Mr. Krupp ever was.

1549
01:13:59,175 --> 01:14:01,018
But, you know, George...

1550
01:14:01,175 --> 01:14:03,496
bringing back Krupp
permanently...

1551
01:14:04,295 --> 01:14:06,775
we'll never be
in the same class again.

1552
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:08,136
Yeah, I know.

1553
01:14:09,055 --> 01:14:11,535
But just 'cause we're
in separate classes,

1554
01:14:11,615 --> 01:14:13,219
doesn't mean
we can't be friends...

1555
01:14:14,055 --> 01:14:17,741
Well, yeah. I mean, we'll
always be friends. Right?

1556
01:14:17,895 --> 01:14:20,341
Yeah. Hey, in fact,
you know what?

1557
01:14:20,535 --> 01:14:21,582
Let's do a blood oath.

1558
01:14:21,735 --> 01:14:23,991
But minus the blood. I don't
wanna see the blood. No blood.

1559
01:14:24,015 --> 01:14:25,062
Pinky swear?

1560
01:14:25,215 --> 01:14:26,216
No, that's lame. Mmm-mmm.

1561
01:14:26,575 --> 01:14:28,304
Oh, got it!

1562
01:14:28,615 --> 01:14:30,060
Oh, no. What? No!

1563
01:14:30,215 --> 01:14:31,501
That's not sanitary.

1564
01:14:31,655 --> 01:14:33,464
Can't we just do
a verbal declaration

1565
01:14:33,535 --> 01:14:34,741
of friendship or something?

1566
01:14:35,015 --> 01:14:36,380
Oh. Okay. Yeah, wow.

1567
01:14:36,455 --> 01:14:39,106
I haven't really
prepared anything, but...

1568
01:14:40,535 --> 01:14:42,105
I, Harold...

1569
01:14:42,255 --> 01:14:43,745
hereby declare George

1570
01:14:43,815 --> 01:14:47,456
as my best friend,
permanently, forever.

1571
01:14:47,615 --> 01:14:50,619
And I, George, accept
the permanent rights...

1572
01:14:50,815 --> 01:14:52,055
that Harold has given me

1573
01:14:52,135 --> 01:14:54,058
to be his best friend forever...

1574
01:14:54,215 --> 01:14:56,695
and the constitution
of friends...

1575
01:14:56,855 --> 01:14:57,856
America, friendship.

1576
01:14:58,015 --> 01:14:59,231
And the United States
of America.

1577
01:14:59,255 --> 01:15:00,751
Land and the United States.
Good, okay, yeah.

1578
01:15:00,775 --> 01:15:02,055
It's done. All right, cool.
Phew.

1579
01:15:02,215 --> 01:15:03,944
What a relief.
Yeah, no kidding.

1580
01:15:04,095 --> 01:15:05,455
I mean,
why were we even worried...

1581
01:15:05,495 --> 01:15:07,657
about that whole classroom
thing in the first place?

1582
01:15:07,815 --> 01:15:08,816
You know, I don't know.

1583
01:15:08,975 --> 01:15:10,261
We were younger then.

1584
01:15:10,455 --> 01:15:11,616
Clearly, we have grown.

1585
01:15:11,775 --> 01:15:12,776
Clearly, we have.

1586
01:15:13,135 --> 01:15:14,136
Chums!

1587
01:15:14,255 --> 01:15:15,381
Thank you for chronicling

1588
01:15:15,455 --> 01:15:17,742
my surprisingly
grounded biography.

1589
01:15:17,895 --> 01:15:20,501
The truth is a slippery thing.

1590
01:15:20,655 --> 01:15:21,895
And you nailed it.

1591
01:15:24,095 --> 01:15:26,336
Now it is time to fly again!

1592
01:15:26,495 --> 01:15:28,384
Farewell, my dear sidekicks.

1593
01:15:31,375 --> 01:15:33,104
Goodbye, Captain Underpants.

1594
01:15:33,255 --> 01:15:34,336
Goodbye.

1595
01:15:46,255 --> 01:15:47,666
George! Harold!

1596
01:15:49,615 --> 01:15:51,391
What am I doing in your
tree house again?

1597
01:15:54,335 --> 01:15:55,939
You boys are in big trouble!

1598
01:15:57,295 --> 01:15:58,740
I don't know how big yet...

1599
01:15:58,895 --> 01:16:00,335
Why does this keep happening?

1600
01:16:00,375 --> 01:16:02,218
Where are my clothes?
Where are they?

1601
01:16:04,855 --> 01:16:05,936
I don't get it.

1602
01:16:06,135 --> 01:16:07,216
Why is Krupp so angry

1603
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:09,218
and Captain Underpants so happy?

1604
01:16:09,375 --> 01:16:13,346
Maybe it's because
Captain Underpants had us.

1605
01:16:13,495 --> 01:16:16,021
You know, he had friends.

1606
01:16:16,455 --> 01:16:19,538
We could fix that.

1607
01:16:19,735 --> 01:16:22,420
Yeah, you know, we could.

1608
01:16:23,375 --> 01:16:24,900
So that's how we came

1609
01:16:24,975 --> 01:16:26,465
to pull the rarest prank
of all...

1610
01:16:27,855 --> 01:16:29,220
The prank...

1611
01:16:29,695 --> 01:16:31,026
for good.

1612
01:16:31,215 --> 01:16:32,216
Huh?

1613
01:16:35,375 --> 01:16:37,423
"Do you want to go a date?"

1614
01:16:38,175 --> 01:16:39,222
A date?

1615
01:16:41,175 --> 01:16:42,381
"Love, Edith."

1616
01:16:42,535 --> 01:16:43,741
"Principal Krupp."

1617
01:16:43,935 --> 01:16:44,936
Oh!

1618
01:16:45,255 --> 01:16:49,101
Benjamin Krupp, you sly dog.

1619
01:16:50,175 --> 01:16:52,985
Edith, the lunch lady.

1620
01:16:53,135 --> 01:16:54,466
Big plans tonight, Mr. Krupp?

1621
01:16:54,615 --> 01:16:57,539
No! What?
That's none of your business!

1622
01:16:57,895 --> 01:17:00,944
But, if you must know...

1623
01:17:01,095 --> 01:17:03,826
yeah, I actually do.

1624
01:17:05,375 --> 01:17:07,025
By the way,
I was tidying up my office...

1625
01:17:07,175 --> 01:17:09,416
and I believe
these belong to you...

1626
01:17:09,615 --> 01:17:10,662
Our comics?

1627
01:17:11,375 --> 01:17:13,175
Did you just pull that out
of the garbage can?

1628
01:17:13,255 --> 01:17:14,825
Well, I read them...

1629
01:17:14,935 --> 01:17:15,991
and considering
they're completely

1630
01:17:16,015 --> 01:17:17,062
implausible, juvenile...

1631
01:17:17,135 --> 01:17:19,183
and filled with
the lowest form of wit...

1632
01:17:19,375 --> 01:17:20,706
potty humor...

1633
01:17:20,855 --> 01:17:22,584
they're actually pretty funny.

1634
01:17:23,015 --> 01:17:24,380
See ya later!

1635
01:17:27,295 --> 01:17:29,263
Well, how about that...

1636
01:17:46,255 --> 01:17:47,939
That's a good one.

1637
01:17:48,175 --> 01:17:50,781
You know, it feels good to do
something nice for Mr. Krupp.

1638
01:17:50,935 --> 01:17:52,778
Yeah, you know what? It does.

1639
01:17:52,855 --> 01:17:53,951
Promise we'll never do it again.

1640
01:17:53,975 --> 01:17:55,022
Promise.

1641
01:17:55,095 --> 01:17:56,096
Oh, my!

1642
01:17:56,375 --> 01:17:57,501
I've never been to

1643
01:17:57,575 --> 01:17:59,304
such a fancy restaurant before.

1644
01:18:00,535 --> 01:18:04,904
Well, I had to go all out
for m'lady.

1645
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:08,138
Okay, if you say so, my man!

1646
01:18:10,575 --> 01:18:12,782
Once again,
that brings our story

1647
01:18:12,855 --> 01:18:14,186
to its happy conclusion.

1648
01:18:14,335 --> 01:18:16,455
I think there's some valuable
life lessons in there...

1649
01:18:16,495 --> 01:18:17,496
somewhere.

1650
01:18:17,575 --> 01:18:18,576
What the?

1651
01:18:18,735 --> 01:18:20,146
Eat 'em up, yum, yum!

1652
01:18:20,295 --> 01:18:23,265
You gotta be kidding me! No!

1653
01:18:23,495 --> 01:18:25,304
Yum, yum! Eat 'em up!

1654
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,741
Oh, no!

1655
01:18:30,615 --> 01:18:32,060
Waiter! Check please!

1656
01:18:36,815 --> 01:18:38,579
Principal Krupp!

1657
01:18:38,735 --> 01:18:39,736
Oh, no!

1658
01:18:41,055 --> 01:18:42,341
Help!

1659
01:18:44,055 --> 01:18:45,056
Hang on, sidekicks!

1660
01:18:45,255 --> 01:18:46,256
I don't get it!

1661
01:18:46,375 --> 01:18:47,945
I really thought
breaking that ring

1662
01:18:48,015 --> 01:18:49,665
would get rid of his powers!

1663
01:18:50,615 --> 01:18:53,619
Yeah, well, here we go again!

1664
01:18:57,735 --> 01:18:59,658
Tra-la-laa!

1665
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:13,982
<i>Are you worried
about impending doom?</i>

1666
01:19:14,255 --> 01:19:16,701
<i>Those evil villains
got you filled with gloom</i>

1667
01:19:17,015 --> 01:19:20,019
<i>But don? you fear,
there's a hero in the sky</i>

1668
01:19:20,135 --> 01:19:22,024
<i>The sky, the sky</i>

1669
01:19:22,815 --> 01:19:23,896
<i>it's not a bird</i>

1670
01:19:23,975 --> 01:19:25,386
<i>And it's not a plane</i>

1671

Bring back all that we know</i>

1854
01:27:49,975 --> 01:27:53,343
<i>Our songs the only thing
that's playing on the radio</i>

1855
01:27:55,775 --> 01:27:59,302
<i>On Saturday, Saturday</i>

1856
01:27:59,495 --> 01:28:02,544
<i>The sun has shined
on us, hey, hey, hey, hey</i>
